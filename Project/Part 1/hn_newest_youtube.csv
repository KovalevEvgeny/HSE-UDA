		<p><em>Google </em>has finally achieved what science fiction novels (and various fundraiser campaigns) have been promising us for years: a universal translator which could close linguistic barriers between nations.</p>
<p>The Californian search firm has developed a pair of wireless headphones that it claims can translate up to 40 different languages “in real-time” – and even help you come up with a response.</p>

<p>Their “Pixel Buds” work much in the same way as Babel Fish from the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (it can decode speech and allow users to understand non-native languages).</p>
<p>All you need to do is touch and hold the right earbud to activate Google Assistant, which is available on their latest smartphone. Google Translate will then offer up a somewhat coherent translation of whatever it hears “in real-time” – or at least, fast enough to hold a conversation, the website states.</p>
<p>In a short demonstration at the launch event in San Francisco, the “Buds” are seen to provide a near-instantaneous translation from Swedish to English. But we’re unsure how well this would hold up in the real world.</p>

<p>The translation is currently processed at Google’s artificial intelligence-focused data centers, where the audio is first converted to text, translated, and then turned back into speech, <em>Quartz</em> reports.</p>
<p>As senior vice president of hardware, Rick Osterloh, writes: “You’ll get elegant touch controls that put the Assistant just a tap away and they’ll even help you communicate in a different language.”</p>
<p>Google’s “Pixel Buds” are designed for use with their Pixel 2 smartphone, which was unveiled at the conference this Wednesday along with a range of other hardware announcements.</p>
<p>The tech giant has also produced two new versions of its smart speakers, a laptop and a sleek new virtual reality headset known as “Google Daydream View.”</p>

<p><span class=""drop-cap""><span class=""drop-cap__inner"">B</span></span>y the time Marshall Carpenter’s father broke down the barricaded door of his son’s apartment and physically ripped him away from his electronic devices, the 25-year-old was in a bad way. He could not bear to live a life that didn’t involve hours upon hours of uninterrupted screen time.</p>
<p>“I was playing video games 14 or 15 hours a day, I had Netflix on a loop in the background, and any time there was the tiniest break in any of that, I would be playing a game on my phone or sending lonely texts to ex-girlfriends,” Carpenter says.</p>
<p>We are sitting in a small, plain apartment in a nondescript condo complex in Redmond, Washington, on the outskirts of Seattle. Marshall shares the apartment with other men in their 20s, all of whom have recently emerged from a unique internet addiction rehab program called <a href=""https://netaddictionrecovery.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">reSTART Life</a>.</p>
<p> “I was basically living on Dr Pepper, which is packed with caffeine and sugar. I would get weak from not eating but I would only notice it when I got so shaky I stopped being able to think and play well,” he adds. By then, he’d already had to drop out of university in Michigan and had lost his sports scholarship.</p>
<p>His new friends Charlie and Peter nod sagely. Charlie Bracke, 28, was suicidal and had lost his job when he realized his online gaming was totally out of control. He can’t remember a time in his life before he was not playing video games of some kind: he reckons he began when he was about four and was addicted by the age of nine.</p>

<p>For Peter, 31, who preferred to withhold his last name, the low came when he had been homeless for six months and was living in his car.</p>
<p>“I would stay in church parking lots and put sunshades up on the windows and spend all day in my car on my tablet device,” he says.</p>
<p>He was addicted to internet porn, masturbating six to 10 times a day, to the point where he was bleeding but would continue.</p>
<p>When he wasn’t doing that, he was so immersed in the fantasy battle game World of Warcraft that in his mind, he was no longer a person sitting at a screen, but an avatar: the bold dwarvish hero Tarokalas, “shooting guns and assassinating the enemy” as he ran through a Tolkien-esque virtual realm.</p>
<p>And when he wasn’t doing that, he would read online news reports obsessively and exercise his political opinions and a hair-trigger temper in the comment section of <a href=""http://www.economist.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">The Economist</a>, projecting himself pseudonymously as a swaggering blogger-cum-troll.</p>
<p>“I was a virgin until I was 29. Then I had sex with a lap dancer at a strip club. That’s something I never thought I would do,” he says.</p>
<p>After completing the initial $25,000, 45-day residential stage at the main “campus” a few miles away, clients move into the cheaper, off-site secondary phase. Here they get to share a normal apartment, on the condition that they continue with psychotherapy, attend Alcoholics Anonymous-style 12-step meetings, search for work and avoid the internet for a minimum of six months.<br/></p>
<p>Marshall, Charlie and Peter successfully completed the second phase and have graduated from the reSTART program, but they have chosen to stay in the same apartment complex and rent with other recovering gamers as they continue to reboot their lives.</p>
<p>Mostly they carry only flip phones and have to go to the library when they want to check email.</p>
<p>“I’m taking my life in six-month chunks at this stage. So far I haven’t relapsed into gaming and I’m feeling optimistic,” says Bracke.</p>
<h2>An addiction overwhelmingly afflicting men</h2>

<p>Nine miles east, down a dirt track off a country road that winds through forests, six young men are sitting in a wooden cabin amid a cluster of moss-draped trees – the reSTART campus.</p>
<p>Spring sunshine is flooding through the windows and the only sounds are birds singing and the men cracking their knuckles as they stare at the floor.</p>
<p>They have recently arrived at rehab.</p>
<p>Hilarie Cash, a psychotherapist and the chief clinical officer at reSTART, asks the guys to begin a communication exercise.</p>
<p>Philip, 22, steps into the middle of the group. He’s been here for three weeks and is on a year’s medical leave from Duke University after getting hooked on <a href=""http://blog.dota2.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Dota 2</a>, the sequel to the fantasy battle game Defense of the Ancients. He asks Adam, who only arrived four days ago and is fidgeting awkwardly, to stand up and face him. (The real names of those currently in the residential program have been withheld.)</p>
<p>Kevin, who has been here for four weeks, coaches them through an exercise known in counseling circles as the “listening cycle”, designed to facilitate emotional conversations in relationships.</p>
<p>It’s a basic introduction for the new guy.</p>

<p>Philip, who was underweight when he arrived, says to Adam, who is overweight: “I’m worried that you’re not eating healthily. I noticed you’ve been skipping dinner.”</p>
<p>Adam is meant to repeat back to Philip what he heard him say the problem is. He mumbles, barely audible, and can’t seem to remember what he’s just been told.</p>
<p>He’s unable to focus, and the air is thick with reluctance and embarrassment.</p>
<p>Stephen, another newbie, is gazing at the ceiling, yawning, sighing, then looking mildly irritated.</p>
<p>Alex, 20, comes to the rescue. He arrived at rehab in January but has popped back to visit the group and explains: “It’s so hard at the beginning. Day one here, I was a wreck, and the first two weeks I was backsliding.”</p>
<p>His games of choice were The Legend of Zelda, a solo action adventure series, where “instead of being the depressed piece of shit I was in real life” he could exist as a swashbuckling hero.</p>
<p>Adapting to a tech-free world structured around rural communal living and social skills was a nightmare, he says. “I wouldn’t join in at first and I got called out for it by the others.”</p>

</figure>
<p>The softly spoken Cash, the chief clinical officer, has been sitting quietly in the corner of the cabin, and now she shoos the group off to complete chores before lunch.</p>
<p>They disappear to the main house, where there are no electronic devices of any kind, and only a limited selection of approved books. They can call home from a landline. There’s a piano, some drums and the house dog, an Australian shepherd called Dakota, who sits in on group sessions and seems widely adored.</p>
<p>They do all their own cleaning and laundry and communal cooking of healthy meals. They must make their beds before 9AM and have group therapy or lighter emotional check-in sessions morning, afternoon and night in the large central room, interspersed with regular appointments with individual therapists. (The Guardian was not granted access to therapy sessions.)</p>
<p>There’s a well-equipped gym and, outside, close to the surrounding woods, is a giant stone chess set, a fire pit and a vegetable garden for the guys to enjoy. </p>
<p>And yes – it’s all guys. Cash says that in the eight years of reSTART, they’ve treated more than 150 men, but only six women.</p>
<p>“Very broadly, my theory is that girls really are more sociable and desire social interaction to a higher degree than boys,” she says. Cash often addresses the men as if they’re children, but when challenged on that later sounds taken aback and says it’s not intentional.</p>
<p>reSTART launched a program for 13- to 17-year-olds this year at a nearby site and there’s already a waiting list. The adult program is for 18- to 28-year-olds, with a maximum of six at a time in the residential phase.</p>
<h2>It has a name: internet gaming disorder</h2>
<p>It’s still early days for research. Cash says experts believe that between 1% and 13% of the US population has some level of internet addiction, and up to 20% of young adults.</p>

<p>“There isn’t consistent criteria to measure this yet,” she says, nor is there agreement in psychiatry that one can be addicted to the internet. But Cash says research has “accumulated to the point where something called internet gaming disorder has made its way into the back section of the the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM), meaning it’s being considered for future possible inclusion.”</p>
<p>The DSM is the handbook of the American Psychiatric Association and is considered the standard US reference book for mental health.</p>
<p>Cash was disappointed that the current, fifth edition, DSM-V, which was updated in 2013, left out sex addiction. But it included gambling disorder for the first time, after 40 years of study.</p>
<p>“Gambling became the first behavioral addiction to be recognized and that opened up the mind-boggling concept that behaviors alone can be addictive – and just as powerful as a chemical addiction,” she says.</p>
<p>The chase and reward patterns of betting, hooking up or advancing in a competitive video game are not unlike a drug high and can become similarly compulsive even though a foreign substance is not being introduced to the bloodstream, Cash and many other experts believe.</p>
<p>“The way a gamer’s brain lights up in euphoria and builds up a tolerance to the rewards, distorting the neuro pleasure pathways over time, is similar to a cocaine addict,” she says.</p>
<p>Cash says some games are much more addictive than others and that they are designed that way, especially the endless massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), amid the estimated $91bn global gaming industry. And they are largely designed by men to appeal to males.</p>
<p>“We used to call World of Warcraft gaming’s crack cocaine, but now that title has passed to League of Legends,” another online game, she says.</p>
<p>Players team up with others online and plan mass battle missions together, often chatting on Skype to their online friends. They debate the games on internet forums and social networks including Facebook, Reddit and 4chan, and can watch people playing via live streaming on YouTube, in an intense, highly competitive, quasi-social life filled with jargon and raw language.</p>
<p>Cash is concerned that parents don’t understand how <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/06/fears-children-addicted-online-games"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">addictive screens are for little children</a> and detrimental to their mental development, especially interactive activities. And she is downright alarmed about the dangers of the nascent virtual reality medium.</p>
<p>In many ways, reSTART is like any other rehab place: first detox, and then face underlying mental health problems, personality traits or life traumas that fuel the dependency and learn how to communicate about that, and finally figure out how to abstain or use in moderation.</p>
<p>“We require abstinence from the internet for the duration of the program and then slow reintegration of technology – but extended abstinence from the things that caused the problem,” she says.</p>

<p>The next day, Andrew Fulton walks into the main house for his shift as a care manager organizing the guys’ schedules.</p>
<p>He’s an ex-client.</p>
<p>“A two-timer, actually. I came here, I relapsed, I came back,” he says.</p>
<p>He first arrived in 2013.</p>
<p>“The first few days after getting here are weird. It’s a version of cold turkey because you’ve been gaming around the clock and suddenly, nothing. I would sweat a lot at night and get headaches. I would lie in bed and perfectly visualize the games I would play. I was craving them, I dreamt about them,” he says.</p>
<p>Fulton, 22, grew up near Seattle and his father worked for Microsoft. His parents limited his access to a games console, but as a teen, Fulton saved up and bought his own.</p>
<p>“I was socially awkward. In middle school, I went through the whole identity crisis thing, and in high school, I never had a girlfriend or anything,” he recalls.</p>
<p>Fulton thought his gaming was under control until he went to college. There, he found he had no desire to meet new people. “I had a couple of friendships, I guess, but I put no energy in and they fell apart,” he says. </p>
<p>“I went to classes at first and then I just started watching YouTube videos all the time, bullshitting around with message boards, the meme culture and gaming,” he says.</p>
<p>He pretended to be sick and thought he would catch up with class soon enough, until he was gaming until 1AM, then 3AM, 5AM, 8AM.</p>
<p>He bought a case of Coca-Cola and stocked up on bread and Lunchables and, for three weeks, immersed himself online and left his room only to use the toilet. “I think I had two showers in that time and I wasn’t really brushing my teeth,” he recalls.</p>
<p>When a student finally raised the alarm and Fulton, then 19, saw a counselor, he was diagnosed with mild depressive disorder.</p>
<p>“They just said: ‘Here’s some Prozac.’ I felt horrible, I weighed 127lbs, I was frail and felt nauseated a lot. I wanted to numb myself and escape, so I’d get lost in the game fantasy world but then I would feel worse, so I’d want to numb more – it feeds on itself,” he says.</p>
<p>He had “some sort of breakdown” and took off on a west coast road trip, to San Diego and back, doing little more than driving and logging on in motels.</p>
<p>Once back, he got a call from one of his grandparents, inviting him round to look at their vacation pictures.</p>
<p>“I went and my grandparents and my parents were there and then my little sister showed up from school and she had this strange guy with her called Scott. They said: ‘This is an intervention.’ An hour later this guy was driving me to reSTART and I stayed there for eight months,” he says.</p>
<p>In that hour, his family told him the effect his gaming habit had had on them.</p>
<p>“I just sat there and stared at the ground and shut off from my feelings while they talked,” he says.</p>
<p>His 17-year-old sister’s words did penetrate, however, and were “hard to hear”.</p>
<p>“She said that growing up she felt like she didn’t have a brother and that I wasn’t going to be there when she graduated or got married.”</p>
<p>Eight months later, things were looking better. He was healthy and had found support among the recovering gamers at reSTART. He went back to college.</p>
<p>“Big mistake,” he says. He didn’t have his computer but he also didn’t have his new rehab friends and was not as emotionally robust as he’d thought.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>He found a new way to escape. After quaffing his roommate’s Nyquil and finding it delightfully numbing, he started taking huge doses of the over-the-counter cough syrup with dextromethorphan, aka DXM, a cough suppressant.</p>
<p>“They call it dexing or Robotripping,” he says, after the popular cough medicine brand Robitussin. If you chug enough DXM, it provides a high similar to combining booze, weed and mild acid, Fulton explains. Side effects include stumbling about like a hallucinating robot that’s blown a fuse, a frazzled serotonin system and an engulfing sense of dread.</p>
<p>Then there were the messy attempts to find a girlfriend.</p>
<p>“It got creepy, sort of stalky. It was bad,” he says.</p>
<p>All came crashing down when he overdosed and was lurching around a supermarket with a knife, texting one of the women he was obsessed with and planning to kill himself in the grocery aisle.</p>
<p>The woman called 911 and Fulton was handcuffed and taken away in an ambulance, spending three days locked in a psychiatric facility.</p>
<p>“My parents said: ‘We own your health insurance, we own your car, we own your phone plan and we’ll take these away if you don’t go to rehab.’ I said no. They took them away, I was homeless for two weeks, couch-surfing, and then I called Scott,” he recalls.</p>
<p>He first went to drug rehab, where some addicts scoffed at his cough syrup and gaming problems, then went back to reSTART. He says he faced the cravings, “faced myself” and finally struggled out of the cycle of depression and escapism.</p>
<p>He then embarked on a nine-month nature course, swapping an emotional wilderness for actual, verdant, Pacific north-west outdoor wilderness. These tales of oblivion are hard to reconcile with the confident person, all trendy beard and brow stud, now jovially wrangling the rehab guys to go outside.</p>
<p>Fulton gathers them to sit on logs around the fire pit.</p>
<p>He begins patting his chest rhythmically and singing a campfire song about wolves, ravens and a grandmother’s dreams. Some sing along enthusiastically, while the newer guys mumble self-consciously. Kevin is looking at the ground and his lips are barely moving. He can’t bring himself to sing but he’s patting his chest in solidarity. It’s a poignant scene. </p>
<p>Fulton leads some exercises in meditation and nature awareness, naming the trees and the plants around them. Then the guys spend an uproarious hour playing ballgames and a version of hide-and-seek in the woods, crawling around in the undergrowth, sticking ferns in their hair. There’s a lot of face-to-face chat, exuberant laughter, and mud. </p>
<p>Later, Fulton mentions, blushing slightly, that he has recently found a girlfriend.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Back at Charlie and Peter’s apartment, Bracke mentions that he, too, is beginning to think about dating. And Peter tells his roommates that his therapist has set him an exercise of asking a woman out for coffee – just as a getting to know you - and he’s trying to muster the courage and tactics to go about that.<br/></p>
<p>Bracke works at Costco and is trying to complete his interrupted bachelor’s degree, studying accounting at a local college. Last year, he bought himself a smartphone and installed an app that monitored his use, to stop himself from gaming. Recently, he removed the app and has not lapsed.</p>
<p>Bracke says he was an earnest introvert as a young boy growing up in small-town Indiana, and reacted to being bullied by his extrovert older brother by retreating into gaming. Although his parents complained, he would retort that they watched too much television and he reminded them he was a straight-A student, so he mainly got away with it.</p>

<p>Bracke’s habit escalated after his beloved grandmother died. Later diagnosed with depression, he discovered that serious depression haunted his mother’s side of the family and his grandmother’s grandmother had tried to kill her children and had killed herself. He also believes, however, as does Cash, the therapist, that compulsive gaming can cause depression from scratch.<br tabindex=""-1""/></p>
<p>As Cash says: “Sometimes it’s hard to tease apart what came first, the addiction or the depression.”</p>
<p>As for Peter, he still won’t allow himself anything other than a flip-phone. But he says “things are getting better fast” in his life.</p>
<p>He’s working as a park maintenance specialist, hiking in his spare time and has been accepted to do a law degree at a state university this fall.</p>
<p>Growing up, he was a math whiz, and his father, whom he described as a 350lb-plus food addict, would eat “three or four meals’ worth of food” while Peter did his algebra.</p>
<p>“When I’d finished, my dad would give me a crisp $5 bill and I would be allowed to go play in the video game arcade,” he says.</p>
<p>When he was 13, his father died suddenly in a local park.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t bear the pain, my soul was torn. My dad was my whole world,” he says.</p>
<p>He blamed himself for not being able to fix his father. The death blew a hole in his life that Peter says he tried to fill by immersing himself online.</p>
<p>Looking back now, he says: “I think a lot of male problematic behavior is channeled into killing people on a screen. I had anger against the world. A paradoxical mix of entitlement and worthlessness and being upset that my life wasn’t going the way I wanted it to.</p>
<p>“I’ve noticed a lot of the trends in games are about ‘my father is lost and I have to find him’ on some quest,” says Peter.</p>
<p>Carpenter muses: “Every time I’ve relapsed I’ve always gone to that game.”</p>
<p>The guys talk a little more about venting frustrations online, and boys not being taught how to communicate with each other very well.</p>
<p>So what did people like them do before the internet?</p>
<p>“Drink. Have sex. Murder people?” says Peter.</p>
<p>“Lots just killed themselves,” says Carpenter.</p>
<p>They let out barks of ironic laughter.</p>
<p>They look at their watches. Peter is going out to walk Charlie’s dog. Bracke is going to bed because his Costco shift starts at 4AM. Carpenter heads off to a 12-step meeting. No one checks their phones.</p>

				<p><a href=""https://www.iafrikan.com/tag/okayafrica/"">OkayAfrica</a>, a digital platform covering culture, music and politics in Afrika, have announced the launch of their new digital music platform - <a href=""https://okaymusic.com"" target=""_blank"">Okaymusic</a>. Launched on 3 October 2013, Okaymusic will mainly be focused on digital music distribution and marketing for Afrika's music artists.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in the age of music streaming, OkayAfrica have taken the route of selling the music on the platform as MP3 and WAV downloads.</p>

<p><img src=""/content/images/2017/10/iAfrikan-News---Okaymusic-2Face-2Baba.jpg"" alt=""OkayAfrica Okaymusic 2Baba""/></p>

<p>“We understand the new digital landscape and will energetically defend artists' rights while making their music available to a global audience,"" said Abiola Oke, CEO at OkayAfrica and Okaymusic.</p>

<p>Okaymusic has been approved as an Apple Music curator have said they will be posting playlists every Wednesday of artists they have already signed. Playlists will also be posted on Spotify and on the Okaymusic Youtube channel. </p>



<p>The platform has already signed Nigeria's Innocent ""2Baba"" Idibia, Niyola, Bankyondbeatz, Adekunle Gold and DJ Spinall, Cameroonian Numerica, Tanzania's Vanessa Mdee, and Zimbabwe's Buffalo Souljah.</p>

<p>“What sets Okaymusic apart is that we are truly partners with our artists. We will never take ownership, we work for the repertoire owner and have their best interests at the forefront of this venture. Artists from anywhere in the world whose music contains those distinct, eclectic elements that we all enjoy are encouraged to join us. This first taste of what Okaymusic has to offer will soon be augmented by a host of artists in a wide range of musical styles,"" said Rikki Stein, who is Fela Kuti's former manager and Head of A&amp;R at Okaymusic.</p>

<p>Okaymusic comes into an industry that already has several options for music fans but their focus on Afrikan music artists and curated playlists could set them apart. The curated playlists angle is something that seems to be a trend with another new entrant into the digital music business, South Africa's <a href=""https://www.iafrikan.com/2017/03/17/naspers-owned-media24-acquires-a-ten-percent-stake-in-south-african-music-streaming-startup-nichestreem/"">Nichestreem</a>, purely focussed on delivering unique curated playlists through their app, similar to what <a href=""https://www.iafrikan.com/2017/07/25/tencent-launches-joox-in-south-africa-after-the-music-streaming-services-popularity-in-some-asian-countries/"">Tencent's  JOOX</a> is doing with its launch in South Africa.</p>&#13;

Rising to the challenge, he said, “I’ll prepare a freshman lecture on it.” But a few days later he told the faculty member, “You know, I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we really don’t understand it.”</blockquote><p name=""9314"" id=""9314"" class=""graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"">This was really inspiring?—?if you can’t reduce the subject to its core and make it accessible for others, that means you don’t really understand it.

<p>Summary: <em>Poor open-source development practices, neglect for the beginner experience, and lack of communication have come up as complaints against how Cognitect stewards Clojure. I address the complaints with a plea that we do more as a community.</em></p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""https://purelyfunctional.tv/issues/purelyfunctional-tv-newsletter-225-spec-deep-learning-new-orleans/"">issue of my newsletter</a>, I mentioned that I wonder if anything is inhibiting Clojure's growth. I got a flood of responses, mostly about the difficulty of learning Clojure and lack of jobs. But several people said that Cognitect actually impedes Clojure's growth.</p>
<p>I've been following the language since 2008. I've written about it on my blog since then. I started studying it more closely since I started my Clojure newsletter in 2012. In other words, I've been observing for a while. I have some opinions on these complaints.</p>
<p>I think we should take all complaints seriously. They need to be examined and understood. Complaints point to deeper problems bubbling below the surface, even if the specifics of the complaints themselves don't hold up to scrutiny. I'm particularly concerned with complaints that indicate that Clojure is not a good language for beginners, that it's not friendly, or that it's not growing. I've built my business on the assumption that Clojure will grow, so it's important that I do what I can to make sure it does. So let's go through the complaints one-by-one.</p>
<h2 id=""complaint"">Complaint</h2>
<p><em>Clojure should be ""more open-source"". They don't involve the community enough. They should accept more patches and let programmers contribute more easily. Bugs languish for years in Jira with no activity. Look at what happened to Zach Tellman and Kyle Kingsbury.</em></p>
<p>This one is hard to address. I have to admit that I've never done serious work on an open source project. Sure, I've submitted a patch here and there, but I've never worked on anything long term. A lot of the complaints about this baffle me, and I know it.</p>
<p>However, from the outside, it looks a lot like what I see happening in other open source communities. People complain about the practices of maintainers, question the priorities of the project, and talk about how slowly things move. I've seen it in the Python community, in the Ruby and Rails community, and in many non-language projects. Since I haven't participated much, it all looks the same to me. Complaints are often louder than appreciation.</p>
<p>However, I have it on good authority that other projects encourage much more involvement from the community. Further, those projects explain the process better up front, and therefore they have a better reputation. As the number of languages approaches infinity, the outliers are getting better and better. Clojurists who want to contribute to a language might be jumping ship to languages with more participation. And this is troubling. If other languages do it better, we could lose the same great programmers that made the community shine.</p>
<p>Rich Hickey made Clojure for himself. He wanted to have a language he could deliver good software in. Concurrency was a major concern and very difficult to get right in Java. Being on the JVM let him work with enterprise clients. We're essentially working with software that is a gift from Rich Hickey.</p>
<p>Rich Hickey appears to value stability and backwards compatibility above everything. His <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk"">recent keynote</a> talked about this directly, and this was the topic of Brian Goetz's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y5Pv4yN0b0"">keynote in 2014</a>. Many change requests are quickly denied because of backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>After that, the next priority seems to be design coherence. Clojure is one of the best-designed languages in the world. Writing a compiler is complicated. It requires a lot of hammock time and a lot of experience. Rich Hickey is a bottleneck on the development, but he's honestly the only one I trust to maintain the quality. I can imagine trusting others, but I can't think of anyone at the moment. As I've watched Clojure develop over the years, I've been constantly amazed by the implementation of original ideas directly from Rich. Having him as a bottleneck is a feature.</p>
<p>Are tickets languishing? When I look into the tickets they are referring to, I can see why you'd think they are languishing. There was a flurry of activity at first, lots of comments, some back-and-forth with the poster, and then nothing for months. What is going on? They might be ignoring it. The worst case is like what happened to Zach Tellman, who did lots of work on a patch, and also backed it up with many hours of work benchmarking it, then silence from the Clojure team for months, only to find out later that Rich developed his own solution.</p>
<p>I think everyone agrees that this is a communication issue and a serious one. Expectations are not being managed appropriately. This is troubling because it is whittling away the good will of well-meaning contributors. I'll address communication more below.</p>
<p>There is one mitigating factor that is very rarely addressed: Clojure is a Lisp. Changes to the core language are not as necessary as in other languages. You can release a library that does things the original designer of the language never dreamed without adversely affecting others. Not everything is possible, but more is possible in Clojure than in other types of languages. <strong>Perhaps the Clojure team is nudging us to use this feature instead of requesting changes to the language.</strong> Even if they are not, it is how I prefer to work. Give me a good core, like Clojure, and I'll build what I need.</p>
<h2 id=""complaint-1"">Complaint</h2>
<p><em>Clojure should focus on the beginner developer experience and developer ergonomics. The two biggest frustrations in the <a href=""http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2017/1/31/state-of-clojure-2016-results"">State of Clojure Survey</a> are error messages and docs, followed by startup time, which appear to not be worked on at all. Do they even care?</em></p>
<p>Let me say this flat out: Clojure's error messages are bad. The stack traces are huge and full of stuff irrelevant to solving the problem. You <em>can</em> learn to read them over time, but many times that involves learning some trivial detail of how a function was implemented. It creates a kind of Stockholm syndrome where people are proud of their battle scars and arcane knowledge. I can totally see how a language like <a href=""http://elm-lang.org/"">Elm</a>, which has been working <a href=""http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans"">explicitly on error messages</a>, looks mighty attractive right now. Not only do their error messages look nice, they signal that the language cares about beginners.</p>
<p>I'm not making any excuses for Clojure, but survey the landscape of languages, and you'll find that good error messages are rare. Elm is the outlier. Elm has shown that with a simpler type system, a focus on the problem, and some elbow grease, static typing information can be turned into really nice errors that help you learn why your code is not compiling. Elm has managed to leapfrog off of the work done in Haskell (who leapfrogged off of Miranda and ML).</p>
<p>I don't think it's fair to say that the Clojure core team doesn't care about error messages. Better error messages have been a small but consistent theme at Clojure conferences for years. See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o75g9ZRoLaw""><em>Illuminated Macros</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt4haSH2xcs""><em>Improving Clojure's Error Messages with Grammars</em></a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5erDyDPzgc""><em>Adapting Clojure to an Intro CS Classroom</em></a>. Clojure.spec was <a href=""https://clojure.org/news/2016/05/23/introducing-clojure-spec"">announced</a> almost exactly one year ago with the explict goal of ""a greatly improved experience for users [of Clojure] when errors occur"". They obviously do care about error messages and they are innovating ways to bring them to us. It sucks that it's taking so long, but it's just a matter of time.</p>
<p>I am concerned, however, that spec by itself won't be enough. The messages will get better, but not quickly enough from the core team. The industry is growing at a tremendous pace, and that constantly increases the need for a better beginner experience. At any point, half of all programmers have less than five years of experience. Clojure attracted a lot of experienced programmers at its beginning. They helped define the terrain we see today. They built Leiningen, Clojars, Ring, nREPL, and the rest of the ecosystem. As Clojure becomes more mainstream, a focus on ergonomics will help it attract new programmers.</p>
<p>I said that spec is not enough. We should not rely on the core Clojure team to focus enough effort on this aspect. However, I think Clojure is uniquely suited for community-driven ergonomic improvements. I mean, I think the core team will focus plenty on it, I just don't want to rely on them for the growth I'll need for my business. We should see spec, the speccing of Clojure's library functions and macros, and the error messages they produce as powerful tools on which to build a better beginner experience. That's how I see them, and I have some ideas for improving error messages without modifying the language. I think there's lots of room for accelerating Clojure's growth here. <strong>Clojure has the potential to lead other language in the quality of error messages.</strong></p>
<p>A great example of error messages in the Clojure world is Figwheel, the ClojureScript autocompilation tool. It does a good job of learning from Elm to provide great error messages. It is an example of <strong>someone from the community stepping up and making things better</strong>. There have been several attempts at improving the stack traces. Nothing seems to have stuck.</p>
<p>Docstrings aren't meant to teach you how to use something. They're for quickly getting info at the REPL without leaving flow. For their purpose, they work, and for other purposes, the <a href=""http://clojuredocs.org/"">community has stepped up</a>. However, docstrings could become tools for learning the language. I've done some experiments with modifying docstrings at runtime and with a lot of writing, all docstrings could be swapped out for more beginner-friendly documentation without modifying the language.</p>
<p>The startup time is slow. It's way worse than average. I've lived with it so long and found so many workarounds, I have trouble seeing the problem anymore. Basically, I restart so rarely and when I know I will need to start a new REPL, I do it before I need it. But I am sympathetic. The long startup times make editor integration a requirement, and asking someone to use a new editor and learn a new language is unfair.</p>
<p>The Clojure team is working on it, but Clojure startup time is going to be slow for the foreseeable future. Obviously, if there were an easy solution, they would release it. I don't have any ideas about how to make the experience better without requiring editor integration.</p>
<p>One alternative is to use the community-developed ClojureScript repls, including <a href=""http://planck-repl.org/"">Planck</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo"">Lumo</a>. They're really fast to start and are suitable for shell scripting using ClojureScript. But they're only for ClojureScript.</p>
<p>Some other aspects of Clojure ergonomics are also addressed by the community. IDE's, project tools, and installation are handled by third parties. There's definitely room for improvement, but that just means there are more opportunities to shine.</p>
<h2 id=""complaint-2"">Complaint</h2>
<p><em>The Clojure team communicates poorly. They are terse in their communication on Jira tickets. They often close them with only a quick, unhelpful message. I don't feel listened to, and worse sometimes I feel outright disrespected. Many times, communication stops for a long time, and I don't know what's going on. I know they're busy, but I also am busy and put a lot of time into those Jira tickets or other communication. Even if I view these in the best possible light, I fear that others might not and that it may scare people away.</em></p>
<p>Okay, we're finally getting to this one. This issue underlies a ton of the other problems. If people had more information about what was happening, or they at least felt heard, the other complaints wouldn't have to be so loud.</p>
<p>Luckily, this is one of the easiest to improve incrementally. Many language communities do much more active blog campaigns. Cognitect's blog is not that active. A short blog once a month about interesting issues they're working on would do wonders. It would simultaneously reveal the development process and humanize the team. I'm not trying to put any work on people's busy agendas, just making a suggestion.</p>
<p>Another thing that could help is a little bit of elaboration. I've seen some pretty terse responses from the Clojure team in Jira. Again, I'm not trying to give anyone more work to do, but this is something that I've learned doing customer support for my own company. As a programmer, I tend to think that short and direct means there's less room for misinterpretation. That's what happens with a compiler, after all. Plus, this isn't personal. It's software. However, people are not like that! The less information they have, the more their imagination fills in the details. And, let me tell you, their imaginations are not generous.</p>
<p>They start to think about whether you care, whether they offended you, whether you were rude, <a href=""http://ashtonkemerling.com/blog/2016/06/11/my-increasing-frustration-with-clojure/#comment-2725685873"">whether you even understood what they meant</a>, etc. It's best just to avoid all of that misunderstanding up front. Someone could be very generous 99 times and not take it personally. But that one time they have a bad day and misinterpret it could wreck the whole thing. Our gooey emotional cores are sensitive like that. A little bit of care can avoid resentment on both sides.</p>
<p>What kind of elaboration am I talking about? For instance, after a user sends me a bug report, I could say ""This is fixed in a release going out tomorrow."" Short and sweet! Not! There's so much blank space to fill in. I thought I was saving my and their time, and that they'd understand that I was directly addressing their concern. Over time, I learned that you actually want to fill in all of that blank space. You should say something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jane,</p>
<p>Thanks for being a customer. We appreciate your business.</p>
<p>So sorry you found a bug, but thanks for reporting it! It's nice to know you care. We count on our users to let us know when something isn't working that we don't know about.</p>
<p>Today, you're in luck. We have fixed the bug and you can expect it to be released tomorrow.</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate if you find anything else. We're here to serve.</p>
<p>Take care,<br/>Eric</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You set up everything in a positive way. There's no room for misinterpretation, at least on the emotional, relational side. Now, I know that you're thinking that this would take forever. If you typed out messages like that for every bug report, that would be a full time job. True! But you don't have to type them.</p>
<p>I've seen some companies with a bot that posts a canned first response to every bug report. People prefer a polite bot to a terse human any day. The bot reminds them of the most important parts of the contribution policy. Instead of linking to a contribution document, which can be interpreted as passive aggressive, the bot kindly reminds the nice contributor of a few points, like please have a test case, and please check to see if a similar ticket already exists, and please remember that the tickets will all be reviewed as soon as we can, and also we love you. I don't use a bot, but I do use canned snippets. They don't take any longer to type but they can save a ton of heartache.</p>
<p>There's also that other type of case, where the Jira ticket goes quiet for a while and an unexpected patch drops after some time. In that case, the thing I'd recommend is to communicate as soon as possible. For instance, if a customer asks me for something, instead of thinking ""I'm busy now, I'll get to that next week"", I write (with polite and flowery prelude) ""I'm busy now, but I'll get to that next week."" And then next week when I can't actually get to it, I write ""It's next week and I can't actually get to it."" It's crazy how just them knowing something makes everything better. They just want to feel heard and in the loop. Telling Zach ""Thanks for the patch. I'll be honest, I don't think I'll have a look at this for a long time"" may have made the difference.</p>
<p>Some projects accept every patch that passes all tests. Others are so conservative as to not accept anything not written by the core team. A few people mentioned that they had different expectations of the Clojure contribution process. They did a lot of work and only later realized that the process was not what they thought. Cognitect could do a better job managing these expectations.</p>
<p>There's one other thing to address, which is users sending messages in a tone that suggests they are ungrateful or entitled. They don't craft messages with care, so why should I? It takes <em>a lot</em> of patience to deal with those. But I just lay it on extra thick. Fight ingrates with gratitude, I guess.</p>
<p>Communication is hard. It takes time. It is something Cognitect could do better. It would make people feel better and even though we're trying to be professional engineers, feelings are still an important factor in choosing a language.</p>
<h2 id=""now-my-plea"">Now, my plea</h2>
<p>The reasoning that a more community-oriented development process would drive growth goes like this:</p>
<p><em>Some people really care about the developer experience. If Clojure allowed more contributions, those people could improve Clojure for beginners. A better beginner experience would attract more developers.</em></p>
<p>It's a good argument, but it forgets that Clojure can be extended from the outside. My plea is that we, as experienced members of the community, channel the energy from complaints directly into community action. No language can be successful without its community members actively building it out. Clojure is an excellent core to build on. The engineering principles and design choices inspire countless people in all language communities. Clojure itself is incredibly stable. And it provides features that many languages can only dream of having. Further, it can be extended with libraries when other languages need core changes.</p>
<p>Clojure had a lot of prolific, brilliant programmers in the early days. Clojure opened a door for latent lispers--people who were into Lisp but didn't have an outlet. They were the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle"">""innovators"" and ""early adopters""</a>. They built out a huge amount of stuff, like Leiningen, Clojars, ClojureDocs, and 4Clojure. Stuff we take for granted today. We'll never have such a density of brilliance again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Clojure community is growing. There are more jobs than ever. Conference attendance is high, with half attendees being first-timers and half using Clojure for less than a year. Beginners are giving Clojure a chance and we need to welcome them warmly.</p>
<p>There are exactly <a href=""https://purelyfunctional.tv/functional-programming-conferences/"">two Clojure conferences</a> in the US. Europe has more variety, for some reason. Europe, good job! There's one in India. Great! We, the community, need to step up to this one. Cognitect has <a href=""http://blog.cognitect.com/cognicast/116"">openly invited more Clojure conferences</a>.</p>
<p>I realize that I could do more to help the community. I'm looking into several projects to address some of the issues. I'm particularly interested in the beginner developer experience and developer ergonomics. If you'd like to help, </p><noscript>let me know (eric at lispcast dot com)</noscript>. We all have unique resources to bring to Clojure. What can you do to help? Further, how can you use Clojure's strengths to make it accessible to more people?
<p><em>I would like to thank all of the people who helped me by commenting on previous drafts and discussing these ideas with me.</em></p>

<p>We recently released a new PvP mode in <a href=""https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite"" target=""_blank"">Fortnite: Battle Royale</a>. This new game mode drops 100 players into a large 5.5 km^2 playable area to duke it out and see who will be the last player standing. The scale of these requirements presented the Fortnite development team with several challenges, which will be discussed here.</p>

<p class=""embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9""><iframe class=""embed-responsive-item"" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2gUtfBmw86Y"">VIDEO</iframe></p>

<p>In the course of developing the Battle Royale game mode we’ve made many performance, memory, and workflow optimizations that not only benefit Fortnite: Battle Royale but every developer using Unreal Engine 4, especially those building games with similar requirements.</p>

<p>All of these improvements are already available in both Perforce and GitHub. Many will ship in Unreal Engine 4.18 this month with the rest shipping in 4.19.</p>

<h2>Dedicated Server Performance</h2>

<p>Our first challenge was to optimize the dedicated server so that it could handle 100 simultaneous players, maintain 20hz, and minimize bandwidth.</p>

<p>With every frame the server sends updates to all actors near that player. That means for each player we need to determine all relevant actors, figure out what has changed on those actors, and send a packet to that player with the differences. In order to minimize CPU time and bandwidth we need send the minimum updates needed to provide a good experience for players.</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMBC2LsJWCY?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;playlist=CMBC2LsJWCY"">VIDEO</iframe>

<p>Much of this work was profiling and optimizing the game code but we also found many engine optimization opportunities along the way.</p>

<p>Here are some of the dedicated server optimizations we made for the engine:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Batched level streaming RPCs to reduce the number of RPCs that need to be sent to clients when they connect. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Make the OS socket buffer sizes configurable and raise them for Battle Royale. This prevents simultaneously connecting clients from overflowing these buffers resulting in excessive server load. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Reduce bandwidth for CharacterMovement RPCs when the character is not standing on any component, such as when jumping or falling. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Added the ability to limit how many players receive updates from the server per frame. We set the limit to 25 in the lobby and 50 during gameplay. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Limit the rate at which clients send movement updates to the server. Prevents clients running at high framerates from causing excessive load on the server. (Shipped with 4.17)</li>
	<li>Added an option to not replicate client ping times to other clients as it results in a lot of network traffic when there are many players. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Removed several memory allocations during replication in FArchive::SerializeIntPacked and changing how CompatibleChecksum is calculated. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Switched property type comparisons from strings to FNames for speed during replication. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Added a way to view a dedicated server's network stats on a client in real time to more easily see stats for cloud-hosted servers. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
	<li>Changes to the ability system to better account for relevancy, which greatly reduces replication cost when using the ability system. (Will be in 4.19)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building and Rendering a Large Map</h2>

<p>The map in Fortnite: Battle Royale has a playable area of 5.5km^2. You can see the entire map at once when parachuting in and we wanted to support long view distances during gameplay. We knew that we needed to optimize our level-of-detail solution to make that possible.</p>

<p><img alt=""Unreal+Engine%2FblogAssets%2F2017%2FOCTOBER+2017%2FFortnite+Battle+Royale+UE+Improvements%2FFNBR_SocialRangerTower-770x433-a1b2112ca6bf4445b2c912c3036fff21ca8193cb"" src=""https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Unreal+Engine%2FblogAssets%2F2017%2FOCTOBER+2017%2FFortnite+Battle+Royale+UE+Improvements%2FFNBR_SocialRangerTower-770x433-a1b2112ca6bf4445b2c912c3036fff21ca8193cb.jpg""/></p>

<p>We used the Hierarchical LOD (HLOD) feature in the engine, backed by Simplygon, to combine regions of the map into single low-poly meshes that could be drawn in a single draw call when viewed from a distance. Those tools already exist – we use them in <a href=""https://www.epicgames.com/paragon/"" target=""_blank"">Paragon</a> – but we needed to make changes to allow our artists to be more efficient.</p>

<p>The way the map was broken up so that artists could collaborate on it didn’t mesh well with our HLOD tools. We made some changes to HLOD to better support that workflow and added a commandlet to rebuild all HLODs in the map that could run overnight rather than requiring artists to rebuild HLODs locally. (Will be in 4.19)</p>

<h2>Shipping on Console</h2>

<p>The extended view distance and player counts of Battle Royale presented several performance and memory challenges on console requiring us to make improvements, particularly relating to memory. Much of this work was game-side content optimization but we also made a number of improvements to the engine.</p>
<iframe allowfullscreen="""" frameborder=""0"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/UfZJHLJKRgc?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;playlist=UfZJHLJKRgc"">VIDEO</iframe>

<p>Here are some of the console improvements, which will ship in 4.18:</p>

<ul>
	<li>[XboxOne + PS4] Improved our low-level memory tracking tools to better identify potential memory optimizations.</li>
	<li>[XboxOne + PS4] More efficient volume texture updates, which reduced peak memory by 240MB+.</li>
	<li>[XboxOne] Added options for different render target layouts to maximize bandwidth utilization on the GPU depending on what rendering features are enabled.</li>
	<li>[XboxOne] Reduced memory overhead in D3D12 descriptor heaps, and saved 120MB.</li>
	<li>[XboxOne] Allocated and freed render targets on-the-fly to reduce memory usage by 100MB+.</li>
	<li>[PS4] Optimized how we handle the texture streaming and defragmentation pools, saving 300-400MB.</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on Battle Royale we identified some issues with input latency in the engine that particularly affected 30Hz games. We were able to make improvements to thread synchronization, reducing latency by around 66ms (the reduction will be around half that in a 60Hz title) to address this problem. These changes make a noticeable improvement to the feel of the game, making it more responsive and easier to aim. (Will be in 4.19)</p>

<h2>More to Come!</h2>

<p>These are just the engine improvements that came out of shipping the first version of Fortnite: Battle Royale. Having had this experience, we’ve identified further improvements we’d like to make, especially related to level streaming and editor performance when working with very large maps, that will make our game teams and our users across the industry more efficient.</p>

<p>To get an idea of what all of this stuff “does,” let me start off with an update on the average day at Stack Overflow. So you can compare to the <a href=""/blog/2013/11/22/what-it-takes-to-run-stack-overflow/"">previous numbers from November 2013</a>, here’s a day of statistics from February 9th, 2016 with differences since November 12th, 2013:</p>

</ul>

<p>You may be wondering about the drastic ASP.Net reduction in processing time compared to 2013 (which was 757 hours) despite 61 million more requests a day. That’s due to both <a href=""http://blog.serverfault.com/2015/03/05/how-we-upgrade-a-live-data-center/"">a hardware upgrade in early 2015</a> as well as a lot of performance tuning inside the applications themselves. Please don’t forget: <a href=""https://blog.codinghorror.com/performance-is-a-feature/"">performance is still a feature</a>. If you’re curious about more hardware specifics than I’m about to provide—fear not. The next post will be an appendix with detailed hardware specs for all of the servers that run the sites (I’ll update this with a link when it’s live).
</p>

<p>So what’s changed in the last 2 years? Besides replacing some servers and network gear, not much. Here’s a top-level list of hardware that runs the sites today (noting what’s different since 2013):</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Microsoft SQL Servers (new hardware for 2 of them)</li>
  <li>11 IIS Web Servers (new hardware)</li>
  <li>2 <a href=""https://redis.io/"">Redis</a> Servers (new hardware)</li>

</ul>

<p>What do we <strong><em>need</em></strong> to run Stack Overflow? <a href=""/blog/2013/11/22/what-it-takes-to-run-stack-overflow/#core-hardware"">That hasn’t changed much since 2013</a>, but due to the optimizations and new hardware mentioned above, we’re down to <strong><em>needing</em></strong> only 1 web server. We have unintentionally tested this, successfully, a few times. To be clear: I’m saying it works. I’m not saying it’s a good idea. It’s fun though, every time.</p>

<p>Now that we have some baseline numbers for an idea of scale, let’s see how we make those fancy web pages. Since few systems exist in complete isolation (and ours is no exception), architecture decisions often make far less sense without a bigger picture of how those pieces fit into the whole. That’s the goal here, to cover the big picture. Many <a href=""https://trello.com/b/0zgQjktX/blog-post-queue-for-stack-overflow-topics"">subsequent posts</a> will do deep dives into specific areas. This will be a logistical overview with hardware highlights only; the next post will have the hardware details.</p>

<p>For those of you here to see what the hardware looks like these days, here are a few pictures I took of rack A (it has a matching sister rack B) during <a href=""http://blog.serverfault.com/2015/03/05/how-we-upgrade-a-live-data-center/"">our February 2015 upgrade</a>:</p>



<p>…and if you’re into that kind of thing, <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/X1HoY"">here’s the entire 256 image album from that week</a> (you’re damn right that number’s intentional). Now, let’s dig into layout. Here’s a logical overview of the major systems in play:</p>

<p><img src=""/blog/content/SO-Architecture-Overview-Logical.svg"" alt=""Logical Overview""/></p>

<h3 id=""ground-rules"">Ground Rules</h3>

<p>Here are some rules that apply globally so I don’t have to repeat them with every setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is redundant.</li>
  <li>All servers and network gear have at least 2x 10Gbps connectivity.</li>
  <li>All servers have 2 power feeds via 2 power supplies from 2 UPS units backed by 2 generators and 2 utility feeds.</li>
  <li>All servers have a redundant partner between rack A and B.</li>
  <li>All servers and services are doubly redundant via another data center (Colorado), though I’m mostly talking about New York here.</li>
  <li>Everything is redundant.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=""the-internets"">The Internets</h3>

<p>First, you have to find us—that’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"">DNS</a>. Finding us needs to be fast, so we farm this out to <a href=""https://www.cloudflare.com/"">CloudFlare</a> (currently) because they have DNS servers nearer to almost everyone around the world. We update our DNS records via an API and they do the “hosting” of DNS. But since we’re jerks with deeply-rooted trust issues, we still have our own DNS servers as well. Should the apocalypse happen (probably caused by the GPL, <a href=""https://twitter.com/JasonPunyon"">Punyon</a>, or caching) and people still want to program to take their mind off of it, we’ll flip them on.</p>

<p>After you find our secret hideout, HTTP traffic comes from one of our four ISPs (Level 3, Zayo, Cogent, and Lightower in New York) and flows through one of our four edge routers. We peer with our ISPs using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol"">BGP</a> (fairly standard) in order to control the flow of traffic and provide several avenues for traffic to reach us most efficiently. These <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/asr-1001-router/index.html"">ASR-1001</a> and <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/asr-1001-x-router/index.html"">ASR-1001-X</a> routers are in 2 pairs, each servicing 2 ISPs in active/active fashion—so we’re redundant here. Though they’re all on the same physical 10Gbps network, external traffic is in separate isolated external <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN"">VLANs</a> which the load balancers are connected to as well. After flowing through the routers, you’re headed for a load balancer.</p>

<p>I suppose this may be a good time to mention we have a 10Gbps <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprotocol_Label_Switching"">MPLS</a> between our 2 data centers, but it is not directly involved in serving the sites. We use this for data replication and quick recovery in the cases where we need a burst. “But Nick, that’s not redundant!” Well, you’re technically correct (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo"">the best kind of correct</a>), that’s a single point of failure on its face. But wait! We maintain 2 more failover <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First"">OSPF</a> routes (the MPLS is #1, these are #2 and 3 by cost) via our ISPs. Each of the sets mentioned earlier connects to the corresponding set in Colorado, and they load balance traffic between in the failover situation. We could make both sets connect to both sets and have 4 paths but, well, whatever.  Moving on.</p>

<h3 id=""load-balancers-haproxy"">Load Balancers (<a href=""https://www.haproxy.org/"">HAProxy</a>)</h3>

<p>The load balancers are running <a href=""https://www.haproxy.org/"">HAProxy</a> 1.5.15 on <a href=""https://www.centos.org/"">CentOS 7</a>, our preferred flavor of Linux. TLS (SSL) traffic is also terminated in HAProxy. We’ll be looking hard at HAProxy 1.7 soon for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2"">HTTP/2</a> support.</p>

<p>Unlike all other servers with a dual 10Gbps LACP network link, each load balancer has 2 pairs of 10Gbps: one for the external network and one for the DMZ. These boxes run 64GB or more of memory to more efficiently handle SSL negotiation. When we can cache more TLS sessions in memory for reuse, there’s less to recompute on subsequent connections to the same client. This means we can resume sessions both faster and cheaper. Given that RAM is pretty cheap dollar-wise, it’s an easy choice.</p>

<p>The load balancers themselves are a pretty simple setup. We listen to different sites on various IPs (mostly for certificate concerns and DNS management) and route to various backends based mostly on the host header. The only things of note we do here is rate limiting and some header captures (sent from our web tier) into the <a href=""https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html#3.1-log"">HAProxy syslog message</a> so we can record performance metrics for every single request. We’ll <a href=""https://trello.com/c/1Oc9cC6u/11-monitoring"">cover that later too</a>.</p>

<h3 id=""web-tier-iis-85-aspnet-mvc-523-and-net-461"">Web Tier (IIS 8.5, ASP.Net MVC 5.2.3, and .Net 4.6.1)</h3>

<p>The load balancers feed traffic to 9 servers we refer to as “primary” (01-09) and 2 “dev/meta” (10-11, our staging environment) web servers. The primary servers run things like Stack Overflow, Careers, and all Stack Exchange sites except <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/"">meta.stackoverflow.com</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/"">meta.stackexchange.com</a>, which run on the last 2 servers. The primary Q&amp;A Application itself is multi-tenant. This means that a single application serves the requests for all Q&amp;A sites. Put another way: we can run the entire Q&amp;A network off of a single application pool on a single server. Other applications like Careers, API v2, Mobile API, etc. are separate. Here’s what the primary and dev tiers look like in IIS:</p>



<p>Here’s what Stack Overflow’s distribution across the web tier looks like in <a href=""https://github.com/Opserver/Opserver"">Opserver</a> (our internal monitoring dashboard):</p>

<p><img src=""/blog/content/SO-Architecture-Opserver-HAProxy.png"" alt=""HAProxy in Opserver""/></p>

<p>…and here’s what those web servers look like from a utilization perspective:</p>

<p><img src=""/blog/content/SO-Architecture-Opserver-WebTier.png"" alt=""Web Tier in Opserver""/></p>

<p>I’ll go into why we’re so overprovisioned in future posts, but the highlight items are: rolling builds, headroom, and redundancy.</p>

<h3 id=""service-tier-iis-aspnet-mvc-523-net-461-and-httpsys"">Service Tier (IIS, ASP.Net MVC 5.2.3, .Net 4.6.1, and HTTP.SYS)</h3>

<p>Behind those web servers is the very similar “service tier.” It’s also running IIS 8.5 on Windows 2012R2. This tier runs internal services to support the production web tier and other internal systems. The two big players here are “Stack Server” which runs the tag engine and is based on <code class=""highlighter-rouge"">http.sys</code> (not behind IIS) and the Providence API (IIS-based). Fun fact: I have to set affinity on each of these 2 processes to land on separate sockets because Stack Server just steamrolls the L2 and L3 cache when refreshing question lists on a 2-minute interval.</p>

<p>These service boxes do heavy lifting with the tag engine and backend APIs where we need redundancy, but not 9x redundancy. For example, loading all of the posts and their tags that change every <code class=""highlighter-rouge"">n</code> minutes from the database (currently 2) isn’t that cheap. We don’t want to do that load 9 times on the web tier; 3 times is enough and gives us enough safety. We also configure these boxes differently on the hardware side to be better optimized for the different computational load characteristics of the tag engine and elastic indexing jobs (which also run here). The “tag engine” is a relatively complicated topic in itself and will be a <a href=""https://trello.com/c/DqklJDSF/29-tag-engine"">dedicated post</a>. The basics are: when you visit <code class=""highlighter-rouge"">/questions/tagged/java</code>, you’re hitting the tag engine to see which questions match. It does <em>all</em> of our tag matching outside of <code class=""highlighter-rouge"">/search</code>, so the <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/308875/new-navigation-release-candidate"">new navigation</a>, etc. are all using this service for data.</p>

<h3 id=""cache--pubsub-redis"">Cache &amp; Pub/Sub (<a href=""https://redis.io/"">Redis</a>)</h3>

<p>We use <a href=""https://Redis.io/"">Redis</a> for a few things here and it’s rock solid. Despite doing about 160 billion ops a month, every instance is below 2% CPU. Usually much lower:</p>

<p><img src=""/blog/content/SO-Architecture-Redis-Utilization.png"" alt=""Redis in Bosun""/></p>

<p>We have an L1/L2 cache system with Redis. “L1” is HTTP Cache on the web servers or whatever application is in play. “L2” is falling back to Redis and fetching the value out. Our values are stored in the <a href=""https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/"">Protobuf format</a>, via <a href=""https://github.com/mgravell/protobuf-net"">protobuf-dot-net</a> by Marc Gravell. For a client, we’re using <a href=""https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis"">StackExchange.Redis</a>—written in-house and open source. When one web server gets a cache miss in both L1 and L2, it fetches the value from source (a database query, API call, etc.) and puts the result in both local cache and Redis. The next server wanting the value may miss L1, but would find the value in L2/Redis, saving a database query or API call.</p>

<p>We also run many Q&amp;A sites, so each site has its own L1/L2 caching: by key prefix in L1 and by database ID in L2/Redis. We’ll go deeper on this in a <a href=""https://trello.com/c/OztwfkG7/16-caching-Redis"">future post</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside the 2 main Redis servers (master/slave) that run all the site instances, we also have a machine learning instance slaved across 2 more dedicated servers (due to memory). This is used for recommending questions on the home page, better matching to jobs, etc. It’s a platform called Providence, <a href=""https://kevinmontrose.com/2015/01/27/providence-machine-learning-at-stack-exchange/"">covered by Kevin Montrose here</a>.</p>

<p>The main Redis servers have 256GB of RAM (about 90GB in use) and the Providence servers have 384GB of RAM (about 125GB in use).</p>

<p>Redis isn’t just for cache though, it also has a publish &amp; subscriber mechanism where one server can publish a message and all other subscribers receive it—including downstream clients on Redis slaves. We use this mechanism to clear L1 caches on other servers when one web server does a removal for consistency, but there’s another great use: websockets.</p>



<p>We use websockets to push real-time updates to users such as notifications in the top bar, vote counts, <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/308875/new-navigation-release-candidate"">new nav</a> counts, new answers and comments, and a few other  bits.</p>

<p>The socket servers themselves are using raw sockets running on the web tier. It’s a very thin application on top of our open source library: <a href=""https://github.com/StackExchange/NetGain""><code class=""highlighter-rouge"">StackExchange.NetGain</code></a>. During peak, we have about 500,000 <strong>concurrent</strong> websocket connections open. That’s a lot of browsers. Fun fact: some of those browsers have been open for over 18 months. We’re not sure why. Someone should go check if those developers are still alive. Here’s what this week’s concurrent websocket pattern looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""/blog/content/SO-Architecture-Bosun-Websockets.png"" alt=""Websocket connection counts from Bosun""/></p>

<p>Why websockets? They’re tremendously more efficient than polling at our scale. We can simply push more data with fewer resources this way, while being more instant to the user. They’re not without issues though—ephemeral port and file handle exhaustion on the load balancer are fun issues <a href=""https://trello.com/c/7nv66g78/58-websockets"">we’ll cover later</a>.</p>



<p>Spoiler: there’s not a lot to get excited about here. The web tier is doing pretty vanilla searches against <a href=""https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch"">Elasticsearch</a> 1.4, using the very slim high-performance <code class=""highlighter-rouge"">StackExchange.Elastic</code> client. Unlike most things, we have no plans to open source this simply because it only exposes a very slim subset of the API we use. I strongly believe releasing it would do more harm than good with developer confusion. We’re using elastic for <code class=""highlighter-rouge"">/search</code>, calculating related questions, and suggestions when asking a question.</p>

<p>Each Elastic cluster (there’s one in each data center) has 3 nodes, and each site has its own index. Careers has an additional few indexes. What makes our setup a little non-standard in the elastic world: our 3 server clusters are a bit beefier than average with all SSD storage, 192GB of RAM, and dual 10Gbps network each.</p>

<p>The same application domains (yeah, we’re screwed with .Net Core here…) in Stack Server that host the tag engine also continually index items in Elasticsearch. We do some simple tricks here such as <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182776.aspx""><code class=""highlighter-rouge"">ROWVERSION</code> in SQL Server</a> (the data source) compared against a “last position” document in Elastic. Since it behaves like a sequence, we can simply grab and index any items that have changed since the last pass.</p>

<p>The main reason we’re on Elasticsearch instead of something like SQL full-text search is scalability and better allocation of money. SQL CPUs are comparatively very expensive, Elastic is cheap and has far more features these days. Why not <a href=""https://lucene.apache.org/solr/"">Solr</a>? We want to search across the entire network (many indexes at once), and this wasn’t supported at decision time. The reason we’re not on 2.x yet is <a href=""https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8870"">a major change to “types”</a> means we need to reindex everything to upgrade. I just don’t have enough time to make the needed changes and migration plan yet.</p>

<h3 id=""databases-sql-server"">Databases (SQL Server)</h3>

<p>We’re using SQL Server as our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth"">single source of truth</a>. All data in Elastic and Redis comes from SQL Server. We run 2 SQL Server clusters with <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh510230.aspx"">AlwaysOn Availability Groups</a>. Each of these clusters has 1 master (taking almost all of the load) and 1 replica in New York. Additionally, they have 1 replica in Colorado (our DR data center). All replicas are asynchronous.</p>

<p>The first cluster is a set of Dell R720xd servers, each with 384GB of RAM, 4TB of PCIe SSD space, and 2x 12 cores. It hosts the Stack Overflow, Sites (bad name, I’ll explain later), PRIZM, and Mobile databases.</p>

<p>The second cluster is a set of Dell R730xd servers, each with 768GB of RAM, 6TB of PCIe SSD space, and 2x 8 cores. This cluster runs <em>everything else</em>. That list includes <a href=""https://talent.stackoverflow.com"">Talent</a>, <a href=""https://openid.stackexchange.com/"">Open ID</a>, <a href=""https://chat.stackoverflow.com/"">Chat</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional"">our Exception log</a>, and every other Q&amp;A site (e.g. <a href=""https://superuser.com/"">Super User</a>, <a href=""https://serverfault.com/"">Server Fault</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>CPU utilization on the database tier is something we like to keep very low, but it’s actually a little high at the moment due to some plan cache issues we’re addressing. As of right now, NY-SQL02 and 04 are masters, 01 and 03 are replicas we just restarted today during some SSD upgrades. Here’s what the past 24 hours looks like:</p>

<p><img src=""/blog/content/SO-Architecture-Opserver-DBTier.png"" alt=""DB Tier in Opserver""/></p>

<p>Our usage of SQL is pretty simple. Simple is fast. Though some queries can be crazy, our interaction with SQL itself is fairly vanilla. We have some legacy <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb425822.aspx"">Linq2Sql</a>, but all new development is using <a href=""https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net"">Dapper</a>, our open source Micro-ORM using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_CLR_Object"">POCOs</a>. Let me put this another way: Stack Overflow has only 1 stored procedure in the database and I intend to move that last vestige into code.</p>

<h3 id=""libraries"">Libraries</h3>

<p>Okay, let’s change gears to something that can more directly help <em>you</em>. I’ve mentioned a few of these up above, but I’ll provide a list here of many open-source .Net libraries we maintain for the world to use. We open sourced them because they have no core business value but can help the world of developers. I hope you find these useful today:</p>

<ul>

<p id=""speakable-summary""><span>An ideal electric utility costs less, is good for the planet and reduces the chances of losing power completely. And it doesn’t ask us to give up creature comforts like AC. </span></p>
<p><span>New utilities are enabled by new technologies and business models, not fuels. </span></p>
<h2><span>Consumers want renewables</span></h2>
<p><span>Almost two-thirds of Americans want renewables to be prioritized. As </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://medium.com/@aoisenju/the-best-thing-to-happen-to-america-fd3ae3a28ce2"" rel=""noopener""><span>Aoi Senju points out</span></a><span>, this desire </span><span>transcends party politics and climate denial. But this doesn’t mean consumers want to pay more.  </span></p>
<h2><span>Zero fuel costs</span></h2>
<p><span>Solar (and wind) power have made rapid progress against other energy options. Solar, and to a lesser extent, wind have benefited from rapid technological improvements and no-operating cost energy sources. In contrast, fossil fuel development is constrained by stable or increasing prices and the fact that technological improvements are made very costly and difficult by ever-harder extraction challenges.</span></p>

<p><span>While solar is seeing a rapid reduction in costs, a critical issue remains — when the sun is out, people tend to use less energy. The chart below illustrates the challenge in California. </span></p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-1551602"" src=""https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-05-at-7-00-57-am.png?w=583&amp;h=498"" alt="""" srcset=""https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-05-at-7-00-57-am.png 583w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-05-at-7-00-57-am.png?w=150&amp;h=128 150w, https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-05-at-7-00-57-am.png?w=300&amp;h=256 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px""/></p>
<p><span>A few different approaches to address this problem are starting to get traction. First, batteries can help. Some of the power generated during the day can be stored and then used at night. </span></p>
<p><span>Second, homes have many connected energy devices such as thermostats and hot water heaters. These can be adjusted to reduce peaks or to shift some of their activities to times when sunshine is abundant. </span></p>
<h2><span>Fleets of batteries</span></h2>
<p><span>Startups like</span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.swellenergy.com/"" rel=""noopener""> <span>Swell Energy</span></a><span> are building out battery fleets among residential homeowners, and in doing so are creating a new category of behind-the-meter, virtual energy providers. Swell Energy is at the hub of the residential energy market and bridges the gap between utilities, installers, manufacturers and the consumer.  </span></p>
<p><span>The company sells and leases batteries to homeowners and then aggregates the batteries to provide additional value to utilities. Swell Energy contracts directly with utilities like Southern California Edison with whom they are building the largest residential virtual power plant to date, a network of 3,000 homes with home batteries and solar that will help SCE reduce peak demand.</span></p>
<p><span>Utility contracts enable Swell Energy to provide leases to customers at more competitive rates than other providers. Utilities benefit by reducing their load and not needing to purchase expensive electricity during peak hours. By benefiting from the local and distributed nature of battery fleets, utilities also can forgo expensive infrastructure investments.</span></p>
<p><span>But what about the benefits to consumers? Batteries enable cheaper, more reliable power for homeowners and are the ideal companion for solar, allowing consumers to store energy for use at night. The dispatchable nature of energy storage allows consumers to store energy from the grid when it is cheapest in the day and use this stored electricity when the rates are most expensive.</span></p>
<p><span>There also is value in having the ability to be independent from the grid, particularly during an outage. </span></p>
<h2><span>Energy independence</span></h2>
<p><span>Hurricane Irma provided a timely case study on energy independence. </span></p>
<p><span>“People need to be prepared for extended outages — weeks,” commented an FPL representative on the expected duration of power outages in Florida following the hurricane. </span></p>
<p><span>In contrast to the grid, cellular services continued to function throughout the hurricane because cellular network operators have installed batteries and generators for their equipment. They learned a tough lesson during Hurricane Katrina, when 70 percent of the network went offline. </span></p>
<p><span>Power outages cause new problems. Without backup power, smart homes become dumb or at least less smart as connected devices shut down. Grid failure also impacts EVs such as cars and rideables. </span></p>
<p><span>Home battery storage offers a new layer of security for homeowners who want to avoid prolonged outages.  </span></p>
<p><span>Backup systems aren’t new, but their market penetration is relatively small. In part, this may be because leasing is typically not available to residential customers, so this appliance looks like an AC purchase. </span></p>
<p><span>Batteries will replace fuel-powered systems, especially in sunnier spots, because they’re already competitive on cost (backup generator costs are higher than grid power). But they’re also easier to maintain — no moving parts means no servicing.</span></p>

<h2><span>Robot energy agents</span></h2>
<p><span>Startups like </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.virtualpeaker.io/"" rel=""noopener""><span>Virtual Peaker</span></a><span> are using existing installed devices to change customer demand. </span></p>
<p><span>The goal is to allow utilities to reduce demand by making adjustments to various devices in consumers’ homes. Today this means applications like AC or water heating, but will also grow to include electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. </span></p>
<p><span>The challenge is how to cut demand without causing discomfort or inconvenience. Virtual Peaker is using machine learning to study behaviors in order to make adjustments that shouldn’t be noticeable to customers, but will have very positive impacts for utilities. </span></p>
<p><span>Programs like this are not new, but so far have been approached via individual devices like smart thermostats. Working with multiple different devices across applications increases the size of the demand reduction that utilities can achieve. </span></p>
<p><span>Another approach to energy agents is focused more on interactions with the grid. </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://gridplus.io/"" rel=""noopener""><span>Grid+</span></a><span> represents consumer interests by buying and selling energy on their behalf. For example, if there is excess energy and the price is right, energy can be traded, but if not it can be stored. This is an “asset-light” way to organize distributed energy assets like battery fleets where each interested party buys or sells resources based on prevailing conditions. </span></p>
<h2><span>New rewards &amp; incentives</span></h2>
<p><span>Incentives are not new. Utilities have offered consumer incentives to everything from more efficient window installations to demand-response incentives to cut high demand from ACs in the summer. </span></p>
<p><span>Platforms like </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://solarcoin.org/en/node/6"" rel=""noopener""><span>Solarcoin</span></a><span> make it quite easy to offer incentives. In fact they offer a coin-based currency for any verified production of solar. Solarcoins are already being used in transactions to receive discounts from solar installers, for example. No doubt the platform might be co-opted by governments and utilities, but if the value of Solarcoin increases, this won’t be necessary. </span></p>
<h2><span>Free energy? </span></h2>
<p><span>Energy cost curves point to steadily declining costs because we’re gradually removing fuel costs. But can energy be free? </span></p>
<p><span>Amazon Dash buttons were intended to help with reordering. But why push a button when your dishwasher can tell Amazon you’re running low? </span></p>
<p><span>It’s not necessary to upgrade your dishwasher. This is where </span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://lids.mit.edu/research/research-highlights/power-disaggregation"" rel=""noopener""><span>disaggregation</span></a><span> comes in. Disaggregation uses algorithms to look at how you use energy. From this data, the algorithms can tell which appliances or devices are in use. </span></p>
<p><span>No, disaggregation isn’t new, but could energy data be used to do more than simply offering consumers a view of how their appliances are using energy? </span></p>
<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTMw-_vuL8k"" rel=""noopener""><span>Fresh Energy</span></a><span> is pioneering the use of disaggregated data to offer new services to customers. For example, data about dishwasher usage might be sold to a vendor of dishwasher soap, or perhaps Amazon, so that the soap supply can be replenished. </span></p>
<p><span>In this way, various brands might subsidize your energy use, in return for ongoing access to your usage data. </span></p>
<h2><span>From rate payer to customer</span></h2>
<p><span>Utilities have built vast infrastructures funded by investors who bet on their ability to collect payments much like governments collect taxes. </span></p>
<p><span>But this deal makes less and less sense for consumers. Consumers are increasingly able to get the same electrons but at a reduced impact on their wallets, not to mention on the climate. And they’re able to take out an insurance policy against being without these electrons altogether. </span></p>

With the exception of Ryzen, but even there, the performance counters apparently aren&#x27;t entirely reliable (meaning sometimes the debugger will go haywire)', 'For more on the x86 emulation and tracing tech that powers this, see:\n&quot;Framework for Instruction-level Tracing and Analysis of\nProgram Executions&quot; (2006)\n<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;events&#x2F;vee06&#x2F;full_papers&#x2F;p154-bhansali.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;events&#x2F;vee06&#x2F;full_papers&#x2F;p154-...</a>', 'As the article talk mentions it as well; I wonder how good it scales for long running binaries and how well it integrates with stuff like .net native.

<p>I'm excited that Microsoft's <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview"">TTD</a> is finally available to the public. Congratulations to the team! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1YJTg_A914"">The video</a> is well worth watching. I haven't used TTD myself yet since I don't have a Windows system at hand, but I've talked to Mozilla developers who've tried it on Firefox.
</p><p>The most important and obvious difference between TTD and rr is that TTD is for Windows and rr is for Linux (though a few crazy people have had success debugging Windows applications in Wine under rr).
</p><p>TTD supports recording of multiple threads in parallel, while rr is limited to a single core. On the other hand, per-thread recording overhead seems to be much higher in TTD than in rr. It's hard to make a direct comparison, but a simple ""start Firefox, display <a href=""https://mozilla.org"">mozilla.org</a>, shut down"" test run on similar hardware takes about 250 seconds under TTD and 26 seconds under rr. This is not surprising given TTD relies on <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/vee06/full_papers/p154-bhansali.pdf"">pervasive binary instrumentation</a> and rr was designed not to. This means recording extremely parallel workloads might be faster under TTD, but for many workloads rr recording will be faster. Starting up a large application really stresses binary translation frameworks, so it's a bit of a worst-case scenario for TTD — though a common one for developers. TTD's multicore recording might be better at reproducing certain kinds of concurrency bugs, though rr's <a href=""/2016/02/introducing-rr-chaos-mode.html"">chaos mode</a> helps mitigate that problem — and lower recording overhead means you can churn through test iterations faster.
</p><p>Therefore for Firefox-like workloads, on Linux, I still think rr's recording approach is superior. Note that when the technology behind TTD was first developed the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05937.pdf"">hardware and OS features</a> needed to support an rr-like approach did not exist.
</p><p>TTD's ability to attach to arbitrary processes and start recording sounds great and would mitigate some of the slow-recording problem. This would be nice to have with rr, but hard to implement. (Currently we require reserving a couple of pages at specific addresses that might not be available when attaching to an arbitrary process.)
</p><p>Some of the performance overhead of TTD comes from it copying all loaded libraries into the trace file, to ensure traces are portable across machines. rr doesn't do that by default; instead you have to run <tt>rr pack</tt> to make traces self-contained. I still like our approach, especially in scenarios where you repeatedly re-record a testcase until it fails.
</p><p>The video mentions that TTD supports shared memory and async I/O and suggests rr doesn't. It can be confusing, but to clarify: rr supports shared memory as long as you record all the processes that are using the shared memory; for example Firefox and Chromium communicate with subprocesses using shared memory and work fine under rr. Async I/O is pretty rare in Linux; where it has come up so far (V4L2) we have been able to handle it.
</p><p>Supporting unlimited data breakpoints is a nice touch. I assume that's done using their binary instrumentation.
</p><p>TTD's replay looks fast in the demo videos but they mention that it can be slower than live debugging. They have an offline index build step, though it's not clear to me yet what exactly those indexes contain. It would be interesting to compare TTD and rr replay speed, especially for reverse execution.
</p><p>The TTD trace querying tools look cool. A lot more can be done in this area.
</p><p>rr+gdb supports running application functions at debug time (e.g. to dump data structures), while TTD does not. This feature is very important to some rr users, so it might be worthwhile for the TTD people to look at.

        <p>I wonder if the folks living through the beginning of the industrial revolution understood the dramatic impact mechanization and automation would have on their daily lives. It probably felt gradual. First it was cheaper to make good iron. Next, the amazing new steam engine caught their fancy. It would have felt slow at first. Marvelous inventions that promised increased prosperity and reduced human effort. In the long term this was certainly true, but only after a major upheaval of civilization.</p>
<p>I don't think it's far fetched or even uncommon to think that the intelligence revolution will be just as promising and problematic for humanity.<sup id=""fnref:amateur""><a href=""#fn:amateur"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> I write this as someone that both loves and loathes technology. I'm also writing this as a father of a young child that worries about the world she is inheriting. I take great pains to keep from being a kook. I think the line between paranoid and prepared is very blurry and the deep experience required to actually understand <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"">artificial intelligence</a> makes it hard to know which side I'm on.</p>
<p>I've included a large number of links in this article. It's not a diatribe or dystopian fantasy. I consider it my research journal on a topic that I think is the greatest change in civilization since the industrial revolution. You and I have the opportunity to see it happen first hand. I'm wondering out loud if we recognize what we are seeing. You can find a list of all the linked references at the end of this article. Some are web articles, some are videos, and others are entire books.</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>Privacy and intimacy, as our parents knew it, is disappearing. Machine learning is transforming the ability of outsiders to pierce the veil of our personal relationships. This is a topic <a href=""http://www.macdrifter.com/2017/04/data-privacy-and-machine-learning-link.html"">I care a great deal about</a> because I believe privacy is <a href=""https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/privacy-and-the-threat-to-the-self/"">vital to our self identity</a>. There's plenty written about <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html"">the value of privacy</a> so I don't want to go on about that topic now. While <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy"">Mark Zuckerberg may still think we no longer need privacy</a> I think he???s probably changed his mind since getting married, having kids, and being investigated by congress.</p>
<p>I do not live under the illusion that we maintain our privacy simply by living mostly offline. Algorithms for mind reading are getting better every month with Goliaths like Facebook, Google, and even Apple driven to convert <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/2146294-facebook-ai-learns-human-reactions-after-watching-hours-of-skype/"">facial expressions into data</a>. These technologies are hitting the part of the growth curve where new unimagined powers are developed faster than we can care.</p>
<p>We now have <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/ai-that-can-determine-a-persons-sexuality-from-photos-shows-the-dark-side-of-the-data-age/?ncid=rss"">algorithms that can determine gender</a> or <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/07/new-artificial-intelligence-can-tell-whether-youre-gay-or-straight-from-a-photograph"">sexual orientation</a> just from looking at images of us. Imagine an uncle sitting down in front of Google Photos and saying ???show me everyone in my family that might be gay.??? Or how about an insurance company doing the same? Or a bar owner.</p>
<p>Running in parallel to all of this artificial intelligence innovation is dramatic improvements with image capture. Resolution is going up and physical size (of both the camera and the image file) is going down. This means we are developing an ever present array of cameras that capture every moment of our lives coupled with an artificial intelligence to draw conclusions and make decisions. I don???t believe that we will see regulations or controls over this technology in my lifetime. China has already begun <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4918342/China-installs-20-million-AI-equipped-street-cameras.html?ito=embedded"">deploying these technologies within their own public spaces</a> and <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/29/moscow-cctv-facial-recognition/"">Russia is likely already do so as well</a>. This is beyond the surveillance model we???ve previously seen, where humans were both the bottle neck and the decision maker. Now computers aggregate our social media, purchasing histories, and family relationships to create a profile. With the rapid development of image recognition algorithms, computers also determine meta attributes based on photo and video analysis to map further sociological conclusions about us. </p>
<p>They never  even asked me any questions.</p>
<h3>Society</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/4/16251226/russia-ai-putin-rule-the-world"">That totalitarian Vladimir Putin recently talking about A.I.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>???It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the recent U.S. election, I think he???s a man to listen to when it comes to the consequences of algorithms on the geopolitical landscape. The calculated application of disinformation is sinister but it is also an age old technique for destabilizing a culture. With so much attention focused on social media such as Facebook and Twitter we have large swaths of the public accessible from outside our own borders. Even worse, we have <a href=""https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/facebook-admits-it-must-fix-its-fake-news-problem"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://uproxx.com/news/google-facebook-twitter-target-ads-anti-semites/"">Google</a> and <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/google-ads-twitter-racism-antisemitism-targeting-bigoted-users-a7949796.html"">Twitter</a> helping to algorithmically target the weakest links in society. The very networks we use <a href=""https://mondaynote.com/more-than-600-global-brands-still-feed-the-fake-news-ecosystem-d1ddfbd80458?source=rss----c537d80ed0a---4"">are the tools of disinformation</a>. There's no distinction.</p>
<p>I don???t believe that A.I. Is inherently bad. I do believe that people <a href=""http://hobosigns.macdrifter.com/2017/07/12/biased-algorithms-are-everywhere-and-no-one-seems-to-care---mit-technology-review"">bring their own biases</a> with them to any project and those can be bad. The fear I have is that the first government to achieve the singularity will instantly become a new kind of superpower.</p>
<p>The stock market is an obvious target for any reasonable powerful A.I. Simply crashing the market would not be very useful in a global economy, but to subtly and undetectably <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-intrusion/sec-says-hackers-may-have-traded-using-stolen-insider-information-idUSKCN1BW029"">manipulate the market</a> in ways that weaken economies would be a powerful tool. We've already seen the perils of  software based <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/17/sec-high-speed-trading_n_5597193.html"">high speed trading</a>. Now imagine a superintelligence whose mission is not to just make money.</p>
<p>While a percentage of people worry about their privacy because ""they have something to hide"", I think it's more concerning that we can be <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/23/advertising-to-women-the-_n_1297974.html"">influenced to act against our own interests</a> while believing that we aren't. The infamous Target example, where they collected data to determine who was pregnant and what they could be offered to get them into their stores shows two things: It's simple to do and very little effort is required to convince people they aren't being gamed.  It's easy to pass this off as just par for the course with advertising. It's not. A mountain of data is exchanged between a many different  of eager partners to determine the exact right way to influence an individual.</p>
<p>From a Target spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we found out that as long as a pregnant woman thinks she hasn???t been spied on, she???ll use the coupons. She just assumes that everyone else on her block got the same mailer for diapers and cribs. As long as we don???t spook her, it works.</p>

Now imagine an algorithm of this sort with virtually infinite compute power. Quantum computing may be the leap into artificial intelligence that <a href=""http://observer.com/2015/08/stephen-hawking-elon-musk-and-bill-gates-warn-about-artificial-intelligence/"">people like Elon Musk worry about</a>. It's easy to write these ""kooks"" off as simple fans of the Terminator franchise when they <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-world-war-iii-russia-china/"">alarm over world war</a>, but it's worth considering their achievements and what they could gain from such statements. For me, I'll trust <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/25/16024444/ai-safety-threat-elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg"">Musk long before Zuckerberg</a>, who has already shown that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/01/mark-zuckerberg-apologizes-for-the-ways-my-work-was-used-to-divide-people/?utm_term=.532bcc36aea1"">he doesn't understand how even Facebook works</a>.</p>

<p>The machine learning revolution will not be all sinister. It may shockingly beneficial to society. <a href=""https://singularityhub.com/2015/11/11/exponential-medicine-deep-learning-ai-better-than-your-doctor-at-finding-cancer/"">The effect of deep learning on medicine</a> could bring about a new age in human health. We're starting to glimpse a future where we can <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/608866/ibm-has-used-its-quantum-computer-to-simulate-a-molecule-heres-why-thats-big/"">accurately model the atomic world</a>. This may not (and I believe it will not) lead directly to new medicines, the power it provides to scientists could accelerate the invention of new, safer, therapies.</p>
<p>There will be social costs for even the most beneficial applications of artificial intelligence: job loss. As our society passed from the enlightenment to the industrial revolution and finally through the information age, our jobs became more cerebral and less manual. Here we are at the start of the twenty-first century and much of our prosperity comes from gathering and applying information. What do we do when algorithms are vastly superior at these jobs?</p>
<p>The field of Radiology is currently seeing the impact of machine learning. It started as enhancements for human specialists. In a short time professional radiologists trained algorithms to do their jobs more efficiently and more accurately. The debate is still on about how much of an impact A.I. will have on the future for Radiologists. <a href=""http://www.rsna.org/News.aspx?id=19018"">Some think</a> it will simply make humans better at their jobs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When, and if, the AUC of an ML algorithm exceeds that of a radiologist, the machine will have learned more than what we now know and will be able to make decisions we cannot now make. At that point, we may be compelled to incorporate that algorithm into our practice. Incorporating these analytical tools into our practice, however, does not mean replacing radiologists. Rather, they will complement our quite remarkable human skills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I don't think anyone doubts that <a href=""http://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/technology-management/end-machine-learning-and-2-other-threats-radiology???s-future"">there will be a dramatic change</a> for what was once a lauded and highly lucrative human career:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computers can also quickly digest complex data sets, the authors added. While even the most trained radiologists will have cognitive limitations, no such issues exist with machine learning.</p>
<p>Chockley and Emanuel also detailed how machine learning is already being used in computer-aided detection (CAD), showing that machines can work ???as well as or better than??? veteran radiologists.</p>

<h3>Quantum Computing</h3>
<p>Quantum computing <a href=""https://after-on.com/episodes/005"">will change everything</a> and it's coming faster than I would have guessed. It's difficult to understand <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhHMJCUmq28"">what exactly quantum computing is</a> yet I find it fascinating. This is one of those areas where I am obliged to take the word of an expert because there's no chance I will  develop an expertise in the field. The short version I've come up with is that a quantum computer co-ops parallel universes to perform its calculations. I love that idea <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dXNmbiGPS4"">even if it's not a complete explanation</a>.</p>
<p>A 500 qubit computer will probably be achieved before I die. At that point no encryption we use today will mean anything.<sup id=""fnref:500qubit""><a href=""#fn:500qubit"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> Quantum computing is real today. It's not a fantasy. We only know what is being done in the commercial realm. We have no idea how far countries like China will take the technology until they've already broken through all modes of encryption. It's compelling that China is already working on  <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/02/Scientists-China-unhackable-quantum-video-call/"">un-hackable quantum encryption for their communications</a>.</p>
<p>These two parallel lines of work will likely coalesce into the singularity. Even if we fall short of achieving the singularity, <a href=""https://after-on.com/episodes/007"">super intelligence will still be a tipping point for our culture</a> that few people are preparing for.</p>
<p>We???re monkeys in a tree that just figured out how to make fire. Eventually we???re going to set ourselves a blaze and then blame the flammable tree.</p>
<h3>Where Next</h3>
<p>This front is being moved from several directions. Some are in the public sector but many (maybe most) are not. I think it's expected that national intelligence agencies are deeply concerned and energized about artificial intelligence but I also think the biggest advancements will come from private corporations working in private, such as <a href=""http://www.techmeme.com/170907/p18#a170907p18"">Amazon's efforts with their Barcelona group</a>, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/15/facebook-opens-ai-research-lab-montreal/"">Facebook's Montreal group</a>, or even Apple's own deep learning team. <a href=""https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/18/ai-weekly-google-shifts-from-mobile-first-to-ai-first-world/"">Google already declared their intention of ""AI First""</a> and I'm sure we will only see the tail end of their achivements through their consumer products. </p>
<p>There are <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608777/why-googles-ai-can-write-beautiful-songs-but-still-cant-tell-a-joke/"">major hurdles to overcame yet</a>. Many of the biggest advancements in this field will only be apparent through head-scratchingly impressive new features or scary-accurate new advertisements. When we see these advances, they will already be old technology. That's what worries we. By the time the public sees the truly great breakthroughs the power will already have shifted. By the time a company can purposefully manipulate the market it will be too late. I don't think we are talking about a scenario where large corporations do battle with each other using similar weapons. On it's surface that would be fine because they would neutralize each other. I think what we will see is one company suddenly becoming so massively dominate that within weeks their control of the free market is insurmountable. Google reached this point in a gradual and organic method. I don't think that's what the future will look like as we climb the exponential curve of computing power and machine learning.</p>

Normalization of taking debt. When someone &quot;buys&quot; something using debt, it must be paid for many times over. They usually don&#x27;t end up paying that all on their own, even though they were responsible for taking the debt.<p>For example, when you buy an over valued house with a mortgage, say during a housing bubble, it doesn&#x27;t make sense for you to try and sell it later on for less than you originally &quot;paid&quot; (with your fancy loan). So you are going to hold onto it, waiting for the market to go &quot;up&quot;, so that you can sell it to yet another person who takes out yet another loan to &quot;pay&quot; for this overpriced house. In the mean time, either you or some renter is busting their ass to pay the interest on that unnecessary loan. It&#x27;s completely ordinary for people who who decided not too take a mortgage to get stuck paying the interest for someone who locked a house into debt.<p>This is completely straight forward but when I try to convey how absurd it is, a lot of common sense people look at me like I&#x27;m crazy.  It&#x27;s considered a financially &quot;sound investment&quot; to buy a house and try to sell it higher. Well what if I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where everyone is just playing monopoly all the time? I feel like there are much more interesting and pressing things to do with our precious human time and energy than cater to these ridiculous cycles of debt.<p>And lot of people who take debt because it&#x27;s so &quot;smart&quot; couldn&#x27;t come up with an original exponential function if their life depended in it.', 'I laughed at the Smaug example because it&#x27;s a good analogy - wealth doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone sitting in a cave.  And aggregate demand is controlled by the Fed - if it&#x27;s too low &quot;because&quot; rich people are sitting on bank accounts, everyone at the Fed should be fired for incompetence.', '&gt; people with lots of money don’t spend it.<p>They do, they just spend it on buying things like factories, companies and real estate. This is usually called investing and will also get money back into the system since the things you buy when investing were built by workers as well.']",32,"<html><body><div><div class=""entry-content"">&#13;
						<p><em>By <a href=""https://evonomics.com/author/steve-roth/"">Steve Roth</a></em></p>
<p>Remember Smaug the dragon, in <em>The Hobbit</em>? He hoarded up a vast pile of wealth, and then he just hung out in his cave, sitting on it (with occasional forays to further pillage and immolate the local populace).</p>
<p>That’s what you should think of when you consider the mind-boggling hoards of wealth that the very rich have amassed in America over the last forty years. The picture at right only shows the very tippy-top of the scale. In 1976 the richest people had <a href=""#data"">$35 million each</a> (in 2014 dollars). In 2014 they had $420 million each — a twelvefold increase. You can be sure it’s gotten even more extreme since then.</p>
<div id=""attachment_9765"" class=""wp-caption alignright""><a href=""http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chart-2.png""><img class=""wp-image-9765"" src=""http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chart-2.png"" alt=""""/></a><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Bottom (visible) pink line is the <i>top</i> 10%.</p></div>
<p>These people could spend $20 million every year and they’d still just keep getting richer, forever, even if they did absolutely nothing except <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp"">choose some index funds</a>, watch their balances grow, and shop for a new yacht for their eight-year-old.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking that they “deserve” all that wealth, and all that income just for owning stuff, because they’re “makers,” think again: between 50% and 70% of U.S. household wealth is “earned” the old-fashioned way (cue John Houseman <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAMRXqQXemU"">voice</a>): it’s <a href=""http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/AlvaredoGarbintiPiketty2017.pdf""><em>inherited</em></a>.</p>
<p>The bottom 90% of Americans aren’t even visible on this chart — and it’s a very tall chart. The scale of wealth inequality in America today makes our crazy levels of income inequality (which have also expanded vastly) look like a Marxist utopia.</p>
<p>American households’ total wealth is about <a href=""https://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Ni_FedBeaSna/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=12&amp;FirstYear=2015&amp;LastYear=2017&amp;Freq=Qtr"">$95 trillion</a>. That’s more than three-quarters of a million dollars for every American household. But roughly 50% of households have zero or negative wealth.</p>
<p>Now of course you don’t expect 20-year-olds to have much or any wealth; there will always be households with none. But still, the environment for young households trying to build a comfortable and secure nest egg — the American dream? — has gotten <a href=""http://www.asymptosis.com/sense-on-stilts-eight-graphs-showing-a-quarter-century-of-wealth-inequality-and-age-inequality.html"">wildly competitive and hostile</a> over recent decades. (If we had a <a href=""https://medium.com/@MattBruenig/nickel-and-dime-socialism-47fcec406295"">sovereign</a> wealth <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=matt+bruenig+norway+swf&amp;oq=matt+bruenig+norway+swf&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.11462j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"">fund</a>, everyone would have a wealth share from birth.)</p>
<p>But here’s what’s even more egregious: that concentrated wealth is strangling our economy, our economic growth, our national prosperity. Wealth concentration drives a <a href=""http://evonomics.com/perfect-markets-concentrate-wealth-strangle-growth-prosperity/"">vicious, downward cycle</a>, throttling the very engine of wealth creation itself.</p>
<p>Because: people with lots of money <em>don’t spend it</em>. They just sit on it, like Smaug in his cave. The more money you have, the less of it you spend every year. If you have $10,000, you might spend it this year. If you have $10 million, you’re not gonna. If you have $1,000, you’re at least somewhat likely to spend it <em>this month.</em></p>
<p>Here’s one picture of what that looks like (<a href=""#data"">data sources</a>):</p>
<p><a href=""http://evonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-4.57.29-PM.png""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-5021"" src=""http://evonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-4.57.29-PM.png"" alt="""" srcset=""http://evonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-4.57.29-PM.png 554w, http://evonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-4.57.29-PM-300x63.png 300w, http://evonomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-4.57.29-PM-150x32.png 150w"" sizes=""(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px""/></a></p>
<p>These broad quintile averages obviously don’t put across the realities of the very poor and the very rich; each quintile spans 25 million households. But the picture is clear. The bottom quintiles turn over 40% or 50% of their wealth every year. The richest quintile turns over 5%. For a given amount of wealth, wider wealth dispersion means more spending. It’s arithmetic.</p>
<p>Now go back to those top-.01% households. They have about $5 trillion between them. Imagine that they had half that much instead (the <em>suffering</em>), and the rest was spread out among all American households — about $20,000 each.</p>
<p>Assume that all those lower-quintile households spend about 40% of their wealth every year. They each get to spend an extra $8,000, and enjoy the results. Sounds nice. And it’s spending that simply won’t happen with concentrated wealth. The money will just sit there.</p>

<p>Now obviously just transferring $2.5 trillion dollars, one time, is not going to achieve this imagined nirvana. Nor is it bloody well likely to happen. That example is just to illustrate the arithmetic. Absent some serious changes in our wildly skewed income distribution (plus capital gains, the overwhelmingly dominant mechanism of wealth accumulation, which <a href=""http://evonomics.com/economists-dont-know-think-wealth-profits/"">don’t count as “income”</a>), that wealth would just get sucked back up to the very rich, like it has, increasingly, for the past forty years — and really, the past several thousand years.</p>
<p>If wealth is consistently more widely dispersed — like it was after WW II — the extra spending that results causes more production. (Why, exactly, do you think producers produce things?) And production produces a surplus — value in, more value out. It’s the ultimate engine of wealth creation. In this little example, we’re talking a trillion dollars a year in additional spending and production. GDP would be 5.5% higher.</p>
<p>If you want to claim that the extra spending would just raise prices, consider <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=f6oz"">the last 20 years</a>. Or the <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=eOV8"">last three decades</a>, in Japan. And if you think concentrated wealth causes better investment and greater wealth accumulation, ask yourself: what economic theory says that $95 trillion in concentrated wealth will result in more or better investment than $95 trillion in broadly dispersed wealth? Our financial system is supposed to <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=%27financial+system%22+investment+intermediate&amp;oq=%27financial+system%22+investment+intermediate&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i21k1.23627.25101.0.25346.11.11.0.0.0.0.115.1038.7j4.11.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.4.374...33i13i21k1.0.a_NWF_p61yo"">intermediate</a> all that, right?</p>
<p>Or ask yourself: would Apple be as successful as it is if its business model was based on selling <a href=""http://www.vcpost.com/articles/27185/20140923/handy-mobile-phones-s-worth-over-million-diamond-rose-iphone.htm"">eight-million-dollar</a> diamond-encrusted iPhones? Broad prosperity is what made Apple, <em>Apple.</em> Concentrated wealth distorts producers’ incentives, so they produce, for instance, a million-dollar Maserati instead of forty (<em>40</em>) $25,000 Toyotas — because that’s what the people with the money are buying. Which delivers more prosperity and well-being?</p>
<p>This little envelope calc is describing a far more prosperous, comfortable, and secure society — far richer and and one hopes far more peaceful than the one we’re facing under wildly concentrated wealth. With the possible exception of a few very rich multi-generational dynasties, <em>everyone’s</em> grandchildren will be far better off 50 years from now if wealth is more widely dispersed. And over that half century, hundreds of millions, even billions of people will live far richer, better lives.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t we want that? Why wouldn’t we <em>do</em> that? (We know the answer: rich people <em>hate</em> the idea — even those who aren’t all that rich but foolishly buy into the whole trickle-down fantasy. And the rich people…have the power.)</p>
<p>By contrast to that possibility, here’s what things look like over the last seven decades:</p>

<p>The last time economic growth broke 5% was in 1984. And the decline continues.</p>
<p>So how do we get there, given that we’ve mostly failed to do so for millennia? Start with a tax system that <a href=""http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2014/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america_in_2014.php#.U1Kh-uZdXgV"">actually is</a> progressive, <a href=""https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4552932077_7935249789.jpg"">like we had</a>, briefly, during the postwar heyday of rampant and widespread American growth and prosperity. And greatly expand the social platform and springboard that gives tens of millions more Americans a place to stand, where they can move the world.</p>
<p>All of this dweebish arithmetic, of course, doesn’t put across the real crux of the thing: power. Money is power. So it is, so it has been, and so it shall be in our lifetimes and our children’s lifetimes (world without end, amen). This is especially true for minorities, who have been so <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/sep/13/median-wealth-of-black-americans-will-fall-to-zero-by-2053-warns-new-report"">thoroughly screwed</a> by our recent Great Whatever. Money is the power to walk away from a shitty job. To hire fancy lawyers and lobbyists, maybe even buy yourself a politician or two. If we want minorities to have power, they need to have money.</p>
<p>Add to that dignity, and respect, which is deserved by every child born: sadly but truly, they are delivered to those who have money. You can bemoan that reality, but in the meantime, let’s concentrate on the money.</p>
<p>If you want to create a workers’ utopia, a better world for all, seize the wealth and income.</p>

<p>Note: Measuring expenditures is very difficult, especially the spending of the very rich. They’re not keen to answer lengthy surveys like the CEX, given that they <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/sunday/what-the-rich-wont-tell-you.html?_r=0"">don’t even want their housekeepers to know</a> that they paid $6 for a loaf of bread. As a result, CEX — which breaks out spending by quintile — <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/cex/pce_compare_199207.pdf"">misses</a> about <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/cex/pce_compare_200815.xlsx"">40%</a> (xlsx) of the spending tallied in the BEA’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — which doesn’t. As a rough corrective for that discrepancy, the spending-by-quintile figures in the table above are CEX measures multiplied by 1.66. This “PCE correction” results in far more plausible spending figures, especially for the top 20%: Average $165,000 in 2103 annual spending versus CEX’s $100,000.</p>

Peterson interviews Paglia, only to find that they agree on just about everything. They riff on their concerns about modern feminism, the myth of the Patriarchy, and the future of Western civilization. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
In the above clip, Paglia and Peterson discuss the problem of the influence of neo-Marxist ideology in the universities --and in Western culture in general-- and postulate that a return to ""the authentic 1960s vision"" of ""cosmic consciousness"" could be the only way to transcend divisions of race, class, gender, and ethnicity that are being exploited and exacerbated by ""lazy"" Marxist intellectuals. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
""On the largest scale, I am concerned about the future of Western culture, because I can see, as a student of history, it looks too much like Ancient Rome,"" Paglia stated. ""Rome became over-expanded, it was at the mercy of bureaucratic creep... And Roman identity eventually got blurred in its incorporation of so many different cultures, which at first was a good kind of multiculturalism, but it eventually over-expanded and collapsed under its own weight.""</p><p/><p><br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
She discussed how the problem is mostly rooted in education, from public schools to top universities: ""I think the public school level has gone to Hell... this kind of feel-good public school education ???which is a form of ideology???and indoctrination right now. It is all about No Bullying, and not about anything substantive.""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
""I think the cafeteria menu of the university curriculum has to be amended,"" she suggested. ""We must return to historical courses that study from the earliest period ??? the Stone Age and early antiquities, in order to give perspective to our analysis of our present culture."" <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
""I have been teaching for 46 years.  I can tell the slow degradation of public school education, to the point now that students have absolutely no sense of world geography or world history. They know absolutely nothing about wars. And the reality, the barbaric reality of most of human history,"" she explained. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Peterson jokes: ""That's triggering.""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Next Paglia lets loose: ""Identity politics has just got to stop!""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
""Identity politics was necessary once,"" she explained. ""We asserted gay rights with the Stonewall rebellion of 1969. We asserted women???s rights with the rebirth of Second Wave Feminism in the 1960s. But this endless preoccupation with a fragmentation of identity... We have to return to the authentic 1960s vision, which is about identity coming from consciousness, which transcends gender, which transcends all these divisions of race. Consciousness itself! Okay?""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
""In the 60s, we had this idea that there was a human sensibility that transcended individual and nation, and there was this cosmic consciousness,"" she lamented. ""This sense of the universe as a whole. To see the human being in relationship to great eternal principles of life and death, mortality, and so on.""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
""Whereas Marxism is blind,"" she said. ""Marxism is very narrow. All it sees is the society. It sees nothing beyond the society! It doesn???t see nature. It is absolutely mad!""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Paglia describes the greatest crime of the Marxist intellectuals as the ""abandonment of the Western Canon.""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
""People asserted that [The Great Western] canon was the product of bias, and of a provincial elitism,"" she said. ""In point of fact, as a student of the history of the arts, I can assure people the canon, overwhelmingly so, is the result of what artists have determined. We say a work is important and canonical because ART IS FOLLOWING IT.  We???re influenced by it! We have this beautiful cascading tradition of influence! It is another part of the philistinism of current education. To believe that there are these external reasons for why a work lasts, why a work written 500 years ago or 1,000 years ago has global relevance.""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Peterson interjects: ""As if it is some sort of political conspiracy that is based on power. As if anybody could even manage that! No matter how nefarious they were.""<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Paglia concludes: ""I do want a multicultural curriculum. I do want a global curriculum. I want all the cultures taught. This is not the answer! This neo-Marxism in the universities is simply lazy. It is a lazy way to assert multiculturalism without actually doing the research and the study of other cultures!""<br/>&#13;

Selected transcript: <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
</p><blockquote><br/>&#13;
JORDAN PETERSON: There???s another strange element to this, which is that, on the one hand, the radical feminist-types, the neo-Marxists, the post-modernists, are very much opposed to the ???patriarchy,??? let???s say. And that is that unidimensional ideological representation--<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
CAMILLE PAGLIA: That has never existed! Perhaps the word can be applied to Republican Rome, and that is it. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PETERSON: Maybe it could be applied usefully to certain kinds of tyranny, but not to a society that is actually functioning.<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PAGLIA: Also Victorian England, arguably, but other than that, to use the word ???patriarchy??? in such a slap-dash way is just amateurish. It absolutely just shows that people know nothing about history whatsoever ??? they have done NO reading. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PETERSON: So what confuses me about that, is that despite the fact that the patriarchy is viewed as this essentially evil entity, and that that is associated with the masculine entity that built this oppressive structure, the antithesis of that, which would actually be femininity ???as far as I can tell???as you see with Care and with child-rearing, is also denigrated. So, it is like the only proper role for women to adopt is a patriarchal role, despite the fact that the patriarchy is something that is entirely corrupt. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
The hypothesis seems to be: The patriarchy would be just fine if women ran it. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
So, no changes, it would just be a transformation of leadership, and somehow that would rectify the fundamental problem, even though it is hypothetically supposed to be structural. </blockquote>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Next Peterson asks Paglia to discuss her view of what to expect in Western culture over the next ten years: ???When you look forward and you try to be optimistic, what the Hell do you see????&#13;
&#13;
</p><blockquote>JORDAN PETERSON: So, I???m just going to close with something: There are elements in my character that are optimistic. I???ve, for example, worked for a UN committee, on the relationship between economic development and sustainability and I found out a variety of things that were very optimistic. <br/>&#13;
Like the fact that the UN set out to halve poverty between 2000 and 2015 worldwide, and they achieved that by about 2010. So we are in the period of the fastest transformation of the bottom strata of the world???s population into something approximating a middle class that has ever occurred. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
And there are all these great technological innovations It looks to me like things could go extraordinarily well if we were careful. But I am not optimistic. Maybe that is just me because I also see five or six things that are happening ??? all of which appear at the level of catastrophe all happening at the same time. So one of the things that I???d like to ask you is: What do you see happening over the next ten years, in the universities and in the culture at large. You just put forward a proposal for the universities for the treatment of women, which I think is a very interesting one, because women have a different timeframe than men. But what the Hell is the proper way forward? I???ve been encouraging young men to tell the truth and to take responsibility, and there is a huge market for that message,  but I???m not convinced by any stretch of the imagination that it is enough. When you look forward and you try to be optimistic, what the Hell do you see? <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
CAMILLE PAGLIA: Well, in the largest scale, I am concerned about the future of Western culture, because I can see, as a student of history, it looks too much like Ancient Rome. Rome became over-expanded, it was at the mercy of bureaucratic creep. And Roman identity eventually got blurred in its incorporation of so many different cultures, which at first was a good kind of multiculturalism, but it eventually over-expanded and collapsed under its own weight.  I am concerned about whether Western culture is in a rapid decline. I think it would be very easy, because we are so interconnected and so overcomplex, to ruin. It would only take one major natural disaster to do that. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
But the universities themselves, are all of a sudden, in the United States, much more attentive to issues of political correctness, because of the riots at Berkeley, which was the capital of free speech. The free speech movement happened in the spring before I entered college in 1964, one of the great principles and inspirational stories of my life, Mario Savio???s assertion of the supremacy of free thought and free speech. I think that perhaps we might just have turned a corner, but it is going to take a very, very long time for the universities to be reformed. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
I think the cafeteria menu of the university curriculum has to be amended. We must return to historical courses studying from the earliest period ??? Stone Age and antiquities, in order to give perspective to our analysis of our present culture. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
I want 50-75% of college administrators fired, and the money to be transferred over to faculty and to libraries and to instruction. I think that the way things are ???the way people are being trained right now, including at the public school level. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
I think the public school level has gone to Hell. When my mother came to America at the age of six, the old public school system was still very strict. She had an excellent education. She got all As even though she started out not speaking English. She learned to speak without an accent. So today, this kind of feel-good public school education ???which is a form of ideology???and indoctrination right now. It is all about No Bullying, and not about anything substantive. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PETERSON: And it is not even seriously about no bullying. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PAGLIA: I can tell in my own students ??? I have been teaching for 46 years.  I can tell the slow degradation of public school education, to the point now that students have absolutely no sense of world geography, or world history. They know absolutely nothing about wars. And the reality, the barbaric reality of most of human history.<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PETERSON: That is triggering. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PAGLIA: Right! What a fantastic culture we live in!<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Identity politics has just got to stop. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
It was important once. I was a rebel against the WASP ???White Anglo-Saxon Protestant???hegemony in American culture. It was suffocating. I was raised in the 1950s when WASPs controlled corporations, and politics and so on. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Identity politics was necessary once. We asserted gay rights with the Stonewall rebellion of 1969. We asserted women???s rights with the rebirth of Second Wave Feminism in the 1960s. But this endless preoccupation with a fragment of identity. We have to return to the authentic 1960s vision, which is about identity coming from consciousness. Which transcends gender, which transcends all these divisions of race. Consciousness itself! Okay? <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
There is no sense of that any longer!<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PETERSON: I see that as a complete abandonment of personal responsibility. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PAGLIA: Yes.<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PETERSON: Because, that consciousness, symbolically, and I got a lot of this from [CG] Jung, and from [Erich] Neumann, well that is the great logos of the West. That is the transcendent principle. Which is: Respect for the primacy of individual consciousness. And what goes along with that primarily isn???t individual rights, although that goes along with it. That is the reason why we HAVE individual rights, is for respect for that. But the responsibility that comes along with being an individual, instead of a member of some group ??? especially a victimized group!<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
I wrote an article with one of my students who had toured the mass grave sites in the former Yugoslavia. And one of the things that our research showed was the best predictor of genocide is victimization on behalf of the group that produces the genocide. An accelerated sense of victimization [leads people to say] we???ll get them before they get us. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
Everyone is being taught now that they are a victim, and no one has any sense of how that is the essential tragedy of being ??? life is suffering. And that the world rests on a foundation of suffering. It is nothing to take personally, it is something to take responsibility for, instead of blaming and resentment, and all the things that have polluted our universities and culture. </blockquote>&#13;
<p>&#13;
Paglia on the ""abandonment"" of the Western Canon:&#13;
&#13;
</p><blockquote>PAGLIA: Also it was the abandonment of the canon ??? people asserted that [The Great Western] canon was the product of bias, and of a provincial elitism and so on. In point of fact, as a student of the history of the arts, I can assure people the canon, overwhelmingly so, is the result of what artists have determined. We say a work is important and canonical because ART IS FOLLOWING IT.  We???re influenced by it! We have this beautiful cascading tradition of influence!<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
It is another part of the philistinism of current education. To believe that there are these external reasons for why a work lasts, why a work written 500 years ago or 1,000 years ago [still] has global relevance.<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PETERSON: As if it is some sort of political conspiracy that is based on power. As if anybody could even manage that! No matter how nefarious they were. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
PAGLIA: Yes. And also, we in the 60s had an idea that there was a human sensibility that transcended individual nation, and there was this cosmic consciousness, okay. This sense of the universe as a whole. To see the human being in relationship to great eternal principles of life and death, mortality, and so on. Whereas Marxism is blind. Marxism is very narrow. All it sees is the society. It sees nothing beyond the society! It doesn???t see nature. It is absolutely mad!<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
How are you going to have a system taught in universities which thinks that this tiny thing of society, compared to the beauty and enormity of nature, should absorb all of our energy and attention. <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
I just think there is a parochialism and a provincialism, and now a kind of systematized elitism, and it has got to be rooted out. I want to return to basics. Great simplicities. Not all these faculty members teaching their little tiny courses that have to do with their own specialty. That has got to stop!<br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
People should pursue whatever they want in the privacy of their research as scholars, certainly, that is necessary. But they must teach in the core curriculum. People must decide: What is crucial for an educated person to know? <br/>&#13;
<br/>&#13;
I do want a multicultural curriculum. I do want a global curriculum. I want all the cultures taught. This is not the answer! This neo-Marxism in the universities is simply lazy. It is a lazy way to assert multiculturalism without actually doing the research and the study of other cultures!<br/>&#13;
We agreed on everything! I knew it! </blockquote>&#13;

Dr. Paglia has been warning about the decline and corruption of the modern humanities for decades, and she is a serious critic of the postmodern ethos that currently dominates much of academia. Although she is a committed equity feminist, she firmly opposes the victim/oppressor narrative that dominates much of modern American and British feminism. <br/>&#13;
 <br/>&#13;
In this wide-ranging discussion, we cover (among other topics) the pernicious influence of the French intellectuals of the 1970's on the American academy, the symbolic utility of religious tradition, the tendency toward intellectual conformity and linguistic camouflage among university careerists, the under-utilization of Carl Jung and his student, Erich Neumann, in literary criticism and the study of the humanities, and the demolition of the traditional roles and identity of men and women in the West. </blockquote><p/></div></div></body></html>",1

    <p>After years of hunting the perfect solution to be and stay productive, I think I finally may have found it: <a href=""http://bulletjournal.com"">a bullet journal</a></p>
<p>Productivity is such a huge topic and such a personal one. I was on a roller coaster over the last years. Weeks of tremendous energy, motivation and productivity were followed by weeks in deep holes without getting anything done at all. </p>
<p>I tried all sorts of todo apps and techniques. The most promising technique was pomodoro for quite a while. But nothing really stuck or helped me overcome the deep valleys.</p>
<p>Then I read about bullet journals a couple months ago and was intrigued. I loved the idea to move away from digital tools and get back to good old pen and paper. It was also a good chance to finally make use of some of the notebooks I had collected over the years, but which lay unused in a drawer. </p>
<h2>What is a bullet journal?</h2>
<figure><img src=""https://bastianallgeier.com/content/notes/13-bullet-journal/bullet-journal.jpg"" alt=""bullet-journal""/></figure>
<p>The basic idea of a bullet journal is to log todos, events and notes for each day in a very simple and fast way. You focus on the current day and write down all the stuff you need to get done or you need to remember. Todos get marked with a dot, events get marked with a circle, notes get marked with a dash. Important stuff gets marked with an additional asterisk. I won't go further into details here, because the <a href=""http://bulletjournal.com"">bullet journal website</a> has some really great docs and there's also a video: </p>
<figure class=""video""/>
<h2>Why does it work?</h2>
<p>There are various points, that make a bullet journal special for me. </p>
<p>I think the most essential aspect really is the fact that it is not in my computer. Writing things down by hand needs more concentration. It's a more conscious form of storing your thoughts. </p>
<p>Every morning, I sit down with my bullet journal and focus on what I need to get done and need to remember. I don't stare into my screen. I don't get dragged away by Twitter or emails. I just sit there for a couple minutes and make myself aware of what's going to happen in the next few hours. </p>
<p>During the day, I write down every new event or todo immediately, which has the same effect of focusing on it once more. It helps to take a short break and recap the priority of each open point on your list. </p>
<p>While almost every todo app hides the finished tasks, the bullet journal leaves a quite beautiful and satisfying overview of each day. About a year ago, I used an app called <a href=""https://home.idonethis.com"">I done this</a> which basically does the same. I often suffer from the illusion that I achieved nothing. Every day seems super short and wasted with lots of tasks, which distract me from the things I really wanted to get done. The bullet journal helps me to get past this. Having written down all the tasks during the day and seeing that list in the evening is the best way to switch off and be happy with my day's work. </p>
<p>Breaking your todo list down into days, makes it feel much more manageable. I didn't have a single day in the last three months when I felt overwhelmed by my work. </p>
<p>According to the bullet journal concept, open tasks need to be moved onto the next day manually. This seems extremely redundant and annoying at first.</p>
<p>But writing down the same task over and over again is a fantastic way to show you how embarrassingly lazy you are or how unimportant a task actually might be. It might not work for everyone, but it sure does for me. </p>
<p>Finally, I think it's the format. The first couple pages have been horrible. My handwriting was a nightmare. But it really started to improve. I now enjoy the process of manually writing again and I absolutely love to see the results. I can't tell exactly what it is, but it's so much more satisfying to open a notebook with dozens of handwritten pages. It's a constant reminder of all the stuff I got done in the last weeks and months. It has become really, really precious to me. </p>
<p>I already ordered five more notebooks in the same format from the same company to make sure that I get a decent series ??? yes, that's the design nerd in me. I started the second book two weeks ago and it felt so great to start with a fresh book and have some decent handwriting in there right from the start. </p>
<p>I also love that it becomes more and more individual. The bullet journal concept is quite open. It offers modules and methods, which you can use, but you don't have to if it doesn't fit. There are also tons of videos on Youtube from bullet journal users, who describe their favorite ways to track stuff. </p>
<p>For example for the second book I decided that I don't need a future log. But instead I have developed my own way of creating a monthly and weekly overview. </p>
<p>I also started to create additional marks and symbols, which I use to highlight certain tasks and events, which is a lot of fun. </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the next book filling up and I know that the system is going to improve with me over time, which is exciting. </p>
<p>The last three months with my bullet journal have been very rewarding and I feel more reliable and more in control. </p>
<p>If you want to give it a try as well, I really recommend to give it time. The advantages show after a week and become even more obvious after a month.</p>  </div>

<small><i>""Note: g'-band and r'-band dip depths (and shapes) may differ, with g'-band being more sensitive to dust cloud scattering due to its shorter wavelength (0.47 vs. 0.62 micron). For a reasonable particle size distribution (e.g., Hanson, 0.2 micron) the extinction cross section ratio would produce a depth at r'-band that is 0.57 x depth at g'-band. If g'-band depth is 0.3 %, for example, depth at r'-band could be 0.17 %. The ""Tabby Team"" measurements (<a href=""/wiki/File:KIC_8462852_TS_r-prime-band_Normalized_Flux_by_TabbyTeam,_20170502-20171004.png"" title=""File:KIC 8462852 TS r-prime-band Normalized Flux by TabbyTeam, 20170502-20171004.png"">Fig. 3</a>) at r'-band are compatible with that small dip depth. Incidentally, none of these shapes resemble exo-comet tail transits (as described by Rappaport et al, 2017 <a rel=""nofollow"" class=""external text"" href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06069"">link</a>); so the mystery of what's producing these week-timescale dips continues! Actually, long oval shapes are known to produce V-shaped dips (think of rings with a high inclination).""</i> - bg</small></span></li>

18,199,15425656,Google CEO Sundar Pichai: 'I don't know whether humans want change that fast',2017-10-07 23:55:42,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/07/google-boss-sundar-pichai-tax-gender-equality-data-protection-jemima-kiss,[],5,"<html><body><div><div class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body"">
<p><span class=""drop-cap""><span class=""drop-cap__inner"">W</span></span>hen <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/10/google-sundar-pichai-ceo-alphabet"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Sundar Pichai</a> was growing up in Chennai, south-east India, he had to make regular trips to the hospital to pick up his mother’s blood-test results. It took an hour and 20 minutes by bus, and when he got there he would have to stand and queue for an hour, often to be told the results weren’t ready.</p>
<p>It took five years for his family to get their first rotary telephone, when Pichai was 12. It was a landmark moment. “It would take me 10 minutes to call the hospital, and maybe they’d tell me, ‘No, come back tomorrow’,” Pichai says. “We waited a long time to get a refrigerator, too, and I saw how my mom’s life changed: she didn’t need to cook every day, she could spend more time with us. So there is a side of me that has viscerally seen how technology can make a difference, and I still feel it. I feel the optimism and energy, and the moral imperative to accelerate that progress.”</p>
<p>Now 45, Pichai is a tall, slight man whose voice is a soft harmony of Indian and American accents. Sitting in his office in a quiet corner of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/23/inside-billion-dollar-palaces-of-tech-giants-facebook-apple-google-london-california-wealth-power"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Google’s headquarters, in Mountain View, California</a>, he speaks thoughtfully, often pausing to find the right phrase. The room houses a few pieces of designer furniture, and the requisite treadmill desk – the perfect metaphor for the pace Pichai has to keep up with. Yet his is a disarmingly calm presence, a world away from the prevailing stereotype of the macho-genius tech CEO; when Pichai got the job, one Google employee was quoted as saying: “All the assholes have left.”</p>
<p>When Google restructured its sprawling business in 2015, it created a parent company, Alphabet, as a home for its more experimental projects – space exploration, anti-mortality – leaving its eye-wateringly lucrative consumer products with Google. Google’s founders, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/larrypage"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Larry Page</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/sergeybrin"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Sergey Brin</a>, moved to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/alphabet"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Alphabet</a>, leaving Pichai as the popular choice for CEO: he had already proved himself with his work on the web browser Chrome and Android, Google’s ubiquitous smartphone brand.</p>
<p>Compared with Page and Brin, and former CEO <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/eric-schmidt"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Eric Schmidt</a>, Pichai is a modest and low-key figurehead. “I don’t do that many interviews,” he says as we sit down in his “huddle” meeting room. But the more we talk, the more it becomes clear that his appointment may be Google’s shrewdest move yet: is he the perfect second generation chief exec? He certainly has a lot in his Gmail inbox. The catalogue of Google controversies is now so big it warrants <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">its own Wikipedia entry</a>, running from tax avoidance and anti-trust issues to hosting extremist content and recent claims of sexist employment practices (it currently faces a class action over pay discrimination).</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Pichai announced a major conceptual shift for the company, moving from “mobile first” to “artificial intelligence [AI] first”. This puts the focus firmly on machine learning, developing voice-recognition products such as <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-home"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Google Home</a>, a smart speaker that responds to verbal requests to play music or control lighting; and, increasingly, visual recognition.</p>

<p>“In an AI-first world, interactions become even more seamless and natural,” Pichai explains. “So, with voice, you can speak to things, and we are working on <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Google</a> Lens, so your computer can see things the way you see them.” Lens, due to launch later this year, will add visual recognition to smartphone cameras: point it at a restaurant, and it will find reviews online. Pichai also cites language translation as a compelling example of advanced AI; instant translation, both verbal and visual, will be possible with a high degree of accuracy within a few years, he says.</p>
<p>But this is where Google’s sell becomes tricky. Many developments in its services – tailoring ads according to personal data, using someone’s location to present local information – are viewed as invasions of privacy. The company has been the target of intense scrutiny on this score, particularly since 2013, when <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA and MI5 had been accessing personal information via technology companies</a>.</p>
<p>With the application of AI, those concerns move into a whole new realm. In 2013, Google bought <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/deepmind"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">DeepMind</a>, the powerful UK-founded AI company, with the aim of developing its capabilities further; but there are profound questions around the safety and ethics of creating machines that can think and act for themselves. Does Pichai acknowledge these concerns? “I recognise that, in the Valley, people are obsessed with the pace of technological change,” he says. “It’s tough to get that part right… We rush sometimes, and can misfire for an average person. As humans, I don’t know whether we want change that fast – I don’t think we do.”</p>
<p>Another frequently raised concern is Google’s seemingly unstoppable growth: a year ago, it unveiled an initiative to reach “the next billion” smartphone users, targeting India with a handful of tools designed for mobiles with slow internet connections, including a version of YouTube.</p>
<p>Isn’t this a kind of technological imperialism, bulldozing a way into the developing world? Pichai is prepared for this argument. “I want this to be a global company,” he argues. “But it is also important that we are a local company… We don’t build only Google products and services – we build an underlying platform, too, so that when you enable smartphones to work well in a country, you also bootstrap the entrepreneurial system there. The two go hand in hand.”</p>
<p>His ambition is to make Android so cheap that it can be used as part of a $30 smartphone; Pichai has said before that he can see “a clear path” to five billion users. “We want to democratise technology,” he says. “Once everybody has access to a computer and connectivity, then search works the same, whether you are a Nobel laureate or just a kid with a computer.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>By any measure, Pichai’s journey to the top of Google is a remarkable one. He was born into a modest middle-class family in Chennai, where he lived in a two-room apartment with his mother, a stenographer; father, an electrical engineer; and younger brother. The family had no car; sometimes all four of them would travel on the family moped. Despite Pichai’s shyness, he was always confident and extremely determined, says Professor Sanat Kumar Roy, who taught him for four years at <a href=""http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur</a>, where he studied metallurgical engineering: “I think he had some genius lurking in him.”</p>
<p>After graduating in 1993, Pichai won a scholarship for a master’s in materials science at Stanford. His father, who earned 3,000 rupees (?63) a month, withdrew nearly a year’s salary from the family savings to pay for his son’s flight to San Francisco. “When I landed, my host family picked me up and driving back it looked so brown,” he remembers. “She corrected me: ‘California is golden, not brown!’”</p>

<p>He speaks of that time as a real culture shock, when he was grappling with his first experiences of computing. “I didn’t understand the internet. The change was too much for me. I think I was a little lost. But I felt the Valley was a special place. People would take me seriously for my ideas, not because of who I was or where I came from. It’s the remarkable thing about America we take for granted: that I could come and, after day one, my opinions mattered.”</p>
<p>After Stanford, Pichai worked at McKinsey and studied for an MBA, before joining Google in 2004. Two projects cemented his reputation within the organisation. Chrome, the now ubiquitous web browser, began as an experiment by his team of 10 engineers. He remembers the moment they got a prototype working, and realised it was pretty good.</p>
<p>But there was significant resistance: nobody wanted the challenge of taking on Microsoft’s mighty Internet Explorer. “Most people here didn’t want us to do a browser, so it was a little bit stealthy. Once we had it up and running, I remember showing it to Larry and Sergey – and even then there was a lot of scepticism.” But Pichai got his way: Chrome was released in 2008 and now accounts for nearly 60% of the market, according to <a href=""https://netmarketshare.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">NetMarketShare</a>, while Internet Explorer languishes on less than 16%.</p>
<p>Android, Google’s smartphone software, is now used by two billion people, but started as a small company bought by Google in 2005. In 2013, Android’s founder Andy Rubin was replaced by Pichai. With characteristic diplomacy, Pichai says now that the business needed a different approach. “To do well and innovate, you need to have a construct by which people can work together, not built on individual people who are superstars.”</p>
<p>Still, there is no denying that Pichai has had something of a superstar’s rise himself. Since becoming CEO, he has overseen seven products, each of them used by more than a billion people: Search, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, Maps, Android and the Google Play Store, through which the company sells apps, music, movies and books.</p>

<p>Running a business that has more customers than the population of any country on Earth comes with its own unique headaches, namely a complex (and sometimes competing) range of geopolitical and social issues. The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/02/is-it-time-to-rein-in-the-power-of-the-internet-regulation"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">prospect of regulation</a> is looming – intensified by recent concern about political ads bought by the Russians to influence the US election. The European Commission last month levied a ?2.2bn fine against Google for abusing its dominance in search advertising, and aims to push ahead with plans to force tech giants to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/21/tech-firms-tax-eu-turnover-google-amazon-apple"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">pay more tax</a>.</p>
<p>Against all these issues, Pichai pits Google’s willingness to look for collaborative solutions. He wearily explains the company’s position on tax; it became so synonymous with “tax-efficient” business practices that a 2015 levy on multinationals was dubbed the “Google tax”. “With tax, we would only argue for a more reasonable global tax structure,” he says. Is he suggesting that Google could and should pay more tax, if the loopholes were closed? That would be quite a contrast to Schmidt, who once said he was “proudly capitalistic” and insisted Google took advantage only of government incentives. Pichai neatly sidesteps this by citing <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/paris-climate-agreement"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">the Paris climate agreement</a> which, at least until recently, was an example of international collaboration: “It is super-important that humanity figures out more global cooperative frameworks to solve problems. No single company or country can change the pace of progress.”</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/20/theresa-may-speaks-out-against-trump-climate-change-stance-at-un"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">In a speech to the UN in New York last month</a>, Theresa May challenged technology firms to take more responsibility for their role in facilitating terrorist activity online, demanding they take down extremist content within two hours, the window in which it is usually shared the most. Isn’t it fair to insist a company such as Google shares responsibility for another unintended consequence of its vastly profitable success?</p>
<p>“She’s trying to address an important problem,” Pichai agrees, “and we should do better than we are doing today. The scale of these things is very difficult. In abstract, we have no disagreement, but the practicality is agreeing on a lot of important things.” These agreements led to an announcement in June that Google would add warnings and block ads from inflammatory videos, and would increase the use of both human and algorithmic moderators to flag and remove the most extreme videos. Within the context of its west coast libertarian ideology, Google also has to strike a difficult balance between allowing all parties freedom to express their views, while not facilitating terrorism. This could explain why, rather than speak more publicly about its policies, Google is choosing to partner with other tech firms, including one recent initiative with the UN counter-terrorism committee. Outsourcing the problem might make it feel slightly more comfortable for Google, which does not want to emphasise its geopolitical power.</p>

<p>Pichai says all the right things, but there is a fine line between thoughtful (the word his colleagues most often use to describe him) and evasive. Google has long had a tendency to avoid anything that looks like a political issue and simultaneously come to represent so many of the indulgences of the tech industry; even San Francisco’s spate of protests against gentrification were targeted around Google, rather than the luxury commuter shuttles of all the other tech firms. “As a company, we end up being a symbol for many things, whether we want to or not,” Pichai says. “We have to hold ourselves to a much higher bar than everyone else. When we make mistakes it is very costly.”</p>
<p>Recently, he fired an engineer who wrote a controversial 10-page memo arguing against diversity initiatives, and claiming that the lack of women in tech was due to biological differences. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/13/james-damore-google-memo-youtube-white-men-radicalization"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">James Damore</a> outraged women at Google and the wider industry, and fired up the rightwing press, by claiming that Google employees with conservative views had to stay “in the closet”. One columnist argued that Pichai should be fired for not acknowledging the engineer’s concerns.</p>
<p>But while many critics seemed to view the decision to fire Damore as a statement about the right to free expression, Pichai viewed it as a workplace issue. “Obviously, you have an important right to freedom of speech, but you also have an equal right to work free of harassment and discrimination. When we talk about women in tech, our representation is around 20%. Nobody is trying to socially engineer anything [here] – we are trying to solve hard problems. We were the first to publish our diversity numbers.”</p>
<p>In April, the US Department of Labor accused Google of “systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce”. In September, a class action lawsuit was filed, alleging women were segregated into lower paying roles. “Any time you are in conflict with the government, you are never going to look good,” Pichai admits. “The overwhelmingly important thing is that we don’t have enough women in senior roles and higher-paying jobs. We are so committed to doing the right thing here, working on the underlying issues that prevent women from achieving their true potential. I feel very strongly about it.”</p>
<p>Jen Fitzpatrick started at Google as an intern in 1999. She is now vice-president of products and engineering, and has worked with Pichai since he joined the company in 2004. Like everyone I speak to at Google, she says he is widely respected for his thoughtfulness. “Sundar is unafraid to make tough calls,” Fitzpatrick says, “but before he makes that call, he makes sure he has heard from the right people across the company. He doesn’t make tough calls in isolation.”</p>
<p>Does he think some people in the Valley saw his appointment as a risk, given the prevailing culture? Apple co-founder <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/stevejobs"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Steve Jobs</a>, Amazon founder <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/jeff-bezos"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Jeff Bezos</a> and Microsoft co-founder <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/billgates"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Bill Gates</a> all cultivated reputations for abrasive egotism, a convenient narrative that excused and even encouraged bad behaviour. In June, the tech industry’s most prominent bad boy, Uber’s former CEO Travis Kalanick, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/20/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">was pushed out of the company he co-founded after months of scandal</a>.</p>

<p>“I’m not a fan of one story that tries to be archetypal,” Pichai says. He met Jobs, and doesn’t think enough is said about his more positive sides, his enthusiasm and drive. “I do think the Valley has good examples of leaders. Hewlett and Packard, who founded the Valley, built a company with a very strong set of values and were remarkably good to their people and partners. I never felt these things were at odds with each other. For the scale of Google, it is even more important to work well with others. In terms of a management philosophy, I try to find people – not that they aren’t individually brilliant at what they do – but people with the ability to transcend the work and work well with others.”</p>
<p>At home, Pichai describes himself as a news junkie who starts every day with an omelette, a cup of tea and a print copy of the Wall Street Journal. Back in India, where newspapers are omnipresent but expensive, he had to wait his turn until his grandfather and father had read the paper, though he did learn to negotiate for the cricket pages. He lives with his wife Anjali, whom he met at college, and their daughter, Kavya, and son, Kiran. He is familiar with the screen-time negotiation that goes on in most family homes, and used to restrict their time, but is now not so sure. All of us are more comfortable when our kids read books, he says, but if they read on a Kindle, does that count? And what if the YouTube videos they watch are educational?</p>
<p>“There are many extraordinary people at Google who would say they spent high school playing video games all the time,” he says. “Video games were how many people got into computer science, so a part of me thinks this generation of kids needs to deal with a new world. Previous generations always feel uncomfortable with new technology.” In the Wright brothers’ era, he points out, there were serious newspaper opinion pieces worrying that bicycles would endanger young women, by enabling them to cycle away and escape. “Our kids are also becoming better at dealing with visual information. But I’m not saying I have the answers. I struggle with it, too.”</p>
<p>In India he has become famous, and is mobbed wherever he goes. His story is the one every family dreams of: hard work and huge reward. Bigger egos might be tempted to exploit that popularity: would he ever return to India and move into politics? He looks slightly embarrassed and shifts in his seat. “I wouldn’t be any good at it… But I do want to go back to India and give back. I feel incredible support when I go there; it is humbling.”</p>
<p>When I ask how it feels to be in charge of Google, Pichai pauses and looks determinedly at the floor, then out of the window. “History shows that the opposite of what people were worrying about is typically true. Go back 10 years and look at the largest market cap companies: the bigger you are, the more you may be at a disadvantage.” He talks of the importance of creating small teams with limited resources, even within a company with 66,000 employees and a market value of $642bn. “As a big company, you are constantly trying to foolproof yourself against being big, because you see the advantage of being small, nimble and entrepreneurial. Pretty much every great thing gets started by a small team.”</p>
<p>It’s not lost on him that Google’s greatest threat could be its own success. And it is also revealing to have it confirmed that when you reach the top the biggest thing you worry about is sliding back down again. “You always think there is someone in the Valley, working on something in a garage – something that will be better.”</p>

19,206,15425612,Undercover at the Bullshit Factory (Dan Lyons),2017-10-07 23:47:50,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/10/undercover-at-the-bullshit-factory,[],2,"<html><body><div><div class=""post-content""><p>Before he became a writer on HBO’s <em>Silicon Valley</em>, Dan Lyons spent over two decades as a tech journalist at Newsweek. But journalism is dead, and in 2012, the 51-year old Lyons found himself laid off, his prospects dim. With jobs for middle-aged magazine editors all but nonexistent, Lyons decided to switch industries and try his hand at being the oldest person at a Cambridge, MA tech startup called HubSpot. Lyons’ bewildering experiences at HubSpot would form the basis of his bestselling book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Disrupted-My-Misadventure-Start-Up-Bubble/dp/0316306088""><em>Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Startup Bubble</em></a>. Lyons is now a popular writer and speaker about the tech economy, and we turned to him to discuss the world of startups, and whether companies like HubSpot really are just a lot of hot air…</p>
<p><em>CA: I guess the clich? about Silicon Valley and tech at the moment is that it’s mostly gobs of money being thrown around or apps that do nothing made by people who insist they’re changing the world. How much of the clich? is true, based on what you saw during your time in this bizarre world?</em></p>
<p>DL: I think it’s too easy to say it’s all like that. There’s a whole spectrum. Some companies are trying to make really interesting things. And even where I was working, we made a real product. It’s just kind of a thing that sends out email spam. I’m not sure it makes the world a better place. But it did automate some of the work people in the marketing departments do. There’s  some  value there. Yeah, though, I’d say the rhetoric was disproportionate to what we were actually doing….</p>
<p><em>CA: As I understand it, the difference between tech culture and the ordinary corporate world is the sense of almost divine mission or a sense that is out of proportion to the nature of what you do, even if it’s useful. How does that actually manifest itself in the workplace culture? </em></p>
<p>DL: Well, I think they lean on that idea of “mission” a lot more patently, say, then traditional companies might do. And I think it’s essentially a way of proving they matter. Where I worked there was the idea that millennials really wanted to do meaningful work. They wanted to do important work that was changing the world. What I found striking was that you could tell people that it was, and they would just believe it. They wanted to be doing something unique or valuable, and if you came at them with a straight face and say “you are changing the world” they would go along with it. I was surprised that people fell for it. But they did.</p>
<p><em>CA: Do you think on the part of founders and CEOs it’s cynical, or are they legitimately true believers? Is it a manipulative way of getting people to work for lower wages with no benefits? Or do they really feel that everyone at every level believes in this?</em></p>
<p>DL: I don’t know if I can make a blanket statement about everybody. I think the people I was working for were completely cynical. It was absolutely a ploy, a stratagem. There are I think CEOs who truly do believe, they’ve drunk their own Kool-Aid. But I think at HubSpot it was just a way to get cheap labor.</p>
<p><em>CA: It’s kind of amazing to me that a young person coming out of college, 22-23, doesn’t see very quickly that they’re working on spam. Is this just a reflection of how desperate a time it is for millennials seeking employment? </em></p>
<p>DL: It may be. I think a lot of people did see through it even at HubSpot. But then what happened was they would just get churned out very quickly. They would either leave on their own or they would get fired. If you didn’t buy into it, you would not last long. Fitting in was the most important key to success. Since my book came out I’ve had so many people write to me, clearly young people, saying, “Oh my God, I was in this world, and I realized the same thing.” They become very disillusioned. A couple I knew at the time became really depressed by it, thinking, “was there anything better?” So I think you’re right. They’re being handed a raw deal, the new generation of people entering the workforce now. They’re being handed in many ways a bad deal, and I think some of them do know that.</p>
<p><em>CA: It’s got to be a very bizarre workplace environment where there is this disjunction between rhetoric and the reality. You’ve spent so much time there in the startup marketing company, does it actually seem cult-like?  What does it feel like to be at one of these workplaces?</em></p>
<p>DL: It’s very much like a cult. In fact, when I was just starting at HubSpot I was also reading Lawrence Wright’s book about Scientology, and the parallel was freaking me out. It was sort of like you go to a room and people tell you about their faith and they’re telling you things that are obviously untrue, blatantly untrue. A dictionary word that had been invented or twisted or means different things. And you have to accept it and nod your head and say, “Ok, I’m on board with that.” It was very much like being in a cult. People regularly referred to the company as “The Cult.”</p>
<p><em> CA: So could you give me an example of that kind of manipulation of language, the way that words mean different things there than they actually mean in the real world?</em></p>
<p>DL: They had a made-up word called delightion.</p>
<p><em>CA: What was that, sorry?</em></p>
<p>DL: Delightion. You take the word delight and add ion on the end. Delightion. I think one of the co-founders came up with the idea that “we aren’t really in the software business, we’re in the business of creating moments of delightion.” And delightion meant any moment when you delighted the customer. Someone using our software would have this magical reverie, this moment where their life would just transform. And we were in that business. We were in the business of creating moments of pure joy for people. And they called it delightion. And people used this term not with air-quotes or rolling their eyes. People talked about it seriously. They didn’t think it was funny at all to say this. When you got fired they called it graduation. You’d get this cheery email saying “so-and-so just graduated, we’re so happy for them.” There was “1+1=3” which was this weird old billionaire thing.</p>
<p>There was spam. So what we did was essentially enable people to send out bulk email. Thousands of people could get an email all at once. And you could train a system so that if you send an email to a thousand people and based on how they responded to it— if they killed it without looking at it, they would get a certain kind of second email. If they opened it but didn’t do anything, they would get a different second email. You could create this tree structure of emails based on the responses to the first one, and you could stack up a whole bunch of these. And so you’d write the opening gambit and they you’d write several versions of the second gambit, and several versions of the third gambit. At the end, just keep poking at people until they do something you wanted them to do.  So essentially it’s spam, but they would say “No, this isn’t spam because we got their names from asking them to fill out a form, so they want these emails. They’re signed up for this. They love it. This is lovable content. We’re helping them because by persistently coming back to them until they buy something, we’re trying to learn what they want. So we’re not bothering people, we’re helping them. In fact, we hate spam!” It’s ultimately the sort of Trumpian Orwellian thing of, “We actually are against spam. We are anti-spam. We’re stamping out spam.” They had t-shirts made that said “no spam.” It’s crazy. We’re in the spam business. It’s hilarious.</p>

<p><em>CA: There’s kind of an incentive for everyone to have the will to believe because nobody wants to believe that they’re in a spam company. The reality is kind of depressing and horrible. So you can create a myth to hide that, as long as everyone buys it forever… </em></p>
<p>DL: You’re right. For example, there are other companies that do the same stuff, more or less. Most of them are sort of grubby businesses, they’re sort of like the online version of direct mail marketing, or people who send those shitty fliers in the mail, or telemarketers who call you at dinnertime and try to sell you solar panels. Basically, it’s one step up above Internet porn. It’s a very grubby business. There’s money to be made. But you can’t tell a bunch of happy quirky millennials who are so earnest and so hyped that what they do is basically evil. So you just tell them it isn’t, you tell them it’s great. I don’t know how old you are, but you might remember a group called “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFORusd3YuU&amp;t=1m05s"">Up With People</a>.”</p>
<p><em> CA: Oh yeah! From the 70s.</em></p>
<p>DL: Very peppy song, “Up, Up with people/You meet ‘em wherever you go.” Really stupid shit, right? This was like that. They were very, very happy about what they did. At one point, they made tracksuits, like cheerleader costumes. Track pants and matching tracksuits in bright orange. All going to a conference together and they had pom-poms and cheered. And they went insane.</p>
<p><em>CA: But when you see those videos of the original “Up With People,” it’s unclear whether it’s really fun to be in “Up With People” or whether it was kind of like a nightmare.</em></p>
<p>DL: Well, I don’t know. I think the people in “Up With People” probably thought it was great. I had someone tell me about the tracksuit thing. The cheerleading thing had happened before I was there, but just before, and someone who did it told me, and she was not 22. She was a woman probably at least 40 who said to me, “Oh, it was so awesome, we just totally rocked this conference, everybody loved us.” I said, “No, no, no, they were laughing at you.” And she said, “No, it was so much greater, we loved it.” I said, “What happened if you don’t put on the tracksuit? Did you get fired?” I don’t know, I don’t think she was lying. Because I’ve done things where I said I’m ashamed of myself for having done it, I needed the job. But no.</p>
<p><em>CA: There must have been times where you felt like you were the only human being in the room. Looking around to see if anyone was feeling…</em></p>
<p>DL: It was again also like being in a cult. Sometimes you’d get a moment alone with people and go “You realize this is crazy, right?” And then they’d be like “Yeah, yeah this is totally crazy.” You know, there’s a resistance. But essentially you also know that you aren’t going to last very long. Get the hell out of there or get fired. And it was very few people, and I think once you are identified as a resistor you are marked for death, but then also nobody would hang out with you because nobody wanted to be seen as your friend because you were a bad influence. So you had to keep it really quiet.</p>
<p><em> CA: Now your experience was at HubSpot, but how widespread do you think this kind of corporate culture is now?</em></p>
<p>DL: I don’t know, but I’ve heard people say that for example, Google is just like this only much, much bigger. They all drink the Kool-Aid. But I don’t know, people at Google didn’t seem like that to me. Apple I think is certainly like that. There are people who work at Apple who just really, really believe, no matter what ridiculous thing Tim Cook says, they believe it. But yeah, I don’t know. I think in startups especially it’s very strong.</p>
<p><em>CA: You’ve been in tech journalism for a couple of decades. Is this a completely new development or has some sector of the corporate world always had kind of a very strong cultural aspect to it? </em></p>
<p>DL: Yeah, I think there are some. I remember when I first started covering tech. There’s this old software company called AspenTech that made database software in the 80s and early 90s. You’d see a guy wearing a—what are those stuffy jackets, what do they call them? Like a pilot’s jacket with “AspenTech” on it. Like, what kind of weirdo thinks he’s really cool walking around with an “AspenTech” jacket on? This giant, giant thing. There’s sort of that. I think it’s a lot stronger now. There’s a lot more talk about mission and changing the world. I don’t remember people at Microsoft ever talking about changing the world. They were open about how much money they were going to make. I didn’t think they had to dress it up as this sort of religious thing. But, yes, certainly Microsoft had a strong culture, they definitely did.</p>

<p><em>CA: In a certain sense, some of them are changing the world because there’s a lot of talk about social media and apps changing the way that human beings interact with one another and think. So it’s not crazy to think that they are, right?</em></p>
<p>DL: If you’re looking at Facebook or Twitter, look at how profoundly that’s changed, not just my life, but I’m sure yours too. So certainly working at Facebook you can say you’re a small part of a very big thing. And if you’re, say, Google you know that you can have an impact that affects a billion people. That’s a pretty big deal. So I think you’re right, they are.</p>
<p><em>CA: I want to ask you a couple of questions about the tech economy more broadly. You had an interesting excerpt from the book where you quoted a friend who said “you don’t get rewarded for creating great technology anymore. It’s all about the business model and having a company that scales quickly.” Just getting big rather than being profitable. That’s kind of bizarre to me, the idea that you wouldn’t have to be profitable. The subtitle of the book suggests it’s a bubble, and you’ve written very critically of SnapChat, for example, you’ve suggested they’re massively overvalued. So what’s going on in the economy that this all fits into?</em></p>
<p>DL: Yeah, I think it’s very much about growth and not about profits. I recently read an expense sheet with all the tech IPOs since 2011, and I was reading the companies that were no longer independent, that had been acquired, and I came up with a list of 60 companies. And of them, only 10 have ever made a profit.</p>
<p><em>CA: I don’t understand how that’s possible. That doesn’t make economic sense to me. How does that work?</em></p>
<p>DL: It works because they’re telling the investors in the public markets that, you know, this company is growing really fast, and eventually it will make money. That might be implied. Or public investors just no longer care because they’re so dense with the returns. So look at the recent IPO of Snapchat for example. But they’re losing a lot of money and, I think that it’s correct to say they have not ever made money. They don’t even have a plan to become profitable. Now if you bought their stock and you pay 20 bucks a share, it may go up to 25, and you’ve made a profit, but it’s speculation. It’s not really investing; it’s speculation. And the market has been in an incredible slow run for years and years so you get a load of stuff like that.</p>
<p><em>CA: That does suggest an incredible mass delusion in a certain sense, doesn’t it?</em></p>
<p>DL: Well, yeah. The delusion carries down to these venture capitalists who in these late stage private rounds have been paying tremendous evaluations for companies, assuming or hoping that they will get a bigger value in the public market, that they will pay even more.</p>
<p><em> CA: These guys are supposed to be geniuses though. Do you think generally venture capitalists are often like people with too much money, or not like the sort of brilliant entrepreneurs, the self-image portrays them as?</em></p>
<p>DL: Well, they’re cocky. I think there’s just a lot more money now in the venture community than there was 20 years ago. I did an analysis recently of the amount of money in 1995 in the venture world versus 2015. I think it was seven or eight times as much money was being invested per year. So it’s just a lot more money looking for ideas. And there really aren’t that many more ideas—or good ideas.</p>
<p><em>CA: So is this a tulips situation then? You would classify this as a major bubble then? </em></p>
<p>DL: I think so, I think it’s an incredible bubble created by all the money. The monetary policies have created an asset bubble.</p>
<p><em>CA: What do you mean by that? </em></p>
<p>DL: They’ve inflated the value of stocks and assets. Pension funds now have more money to invest, and they put a certain percentage of their assets into venture capital each year. So the amount of money flowing into venture capital went up. So it’s just more money there looking for returns. So venture funds used to be, say, 25 or 50 million dollars, a relatively small pool of money. Now the venture funds being raised are a billion dollars. I saw a VC fund saying it has a billion dollars that it needs to put to work. And they only get paid if they put it to work. So they have to go find a place to put the put that billion dollars. It’s almost like supply and demand. A lot of money.</p>
<p><em>CA: You’ve had sort of fascinating and amusing adventures in the world of start-ups and the tech economy. Do you think that generally, this is just something amusing that we can laugh at, or do you actually think there are serious social consequences? I know you come from journalism and the whole reason you’ve entered this is that your whole industry kind of collapsed. And partially that has something to do with companies being eaten by tech capitalism—the Tribune company turning into “<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-tronc/"">Tronc</a>” and Chris Hughes’ ill-fated <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/when-silicon-valley-took-over-journalism/534195/"">takeover of the New Republic</a>. Should we just laugh at Silicon Valley or should we be terrified? </em></p>
<p>DL: I think it has very serious consequences. What’s happening is that this is also contributing to the acceleration of income inequality and wealth disparity. You look at the Oxfam numbers which show eight people now control as much wealth as the bottom half of the world’s population. It used to be 200 people, now it’s eight. Four or five of the eight are techies. So you have this massive transfer of wealth in fewer and fewer hands and technology has accelerated. And we’re not creating competition by distributing wealth for lots of people. We’re creating fly-by-night, get-rich-quick companies that distribute wealth to a few hands. So I think it has very, very dangerous consequences which then, beyond the income disparity, lead to things like Brexit and Trump. I think it’s tremendously dangerous. CA: Well, on that pessimistic note, thanks very much.</p>

20,218,15425454,The tech insiders who fear a smartphone dystopia,2017-10-07 23:10:18,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia,[],2,"<html><body><div><div class=""content__article-body from-content-api js-article__body"" itemprop=""articleBody"" data-test-id=""article-review-body"">
<p><span class=""drop-cap""><span class=""drop-cap__inner"">J</span></span>ustin Rosenstein had tweaked his laptop’s operating system to block Reddit, banned himself from Snapchat, which he compares to heroin, and imposed limits on his use of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Facebook</a>. But even that wasn’t enough. In August, the 34-year-old tech executive took a more radical step to restrict his use of social media and other addictive technologies.</p>
<p>Rosenstein purchased a new iPhone and instructed his assistant to set up a parental-control feature to prevent him from downloading any apps. </p>
<p>He was particularly aware of the allure of Facebook “likes”, which he describes as “bright dings of pseudo-pleasure” that can be as hollow as they are seductive. And Rosenstein should know: he was the Facebook engineer who created the “like” button in the first place. </p>
<p>A decade after he stayed up all night coding a prototype of what was then called an “awesome” button, Rosenstein belongs to a small but growing band of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Silicon Valley</a> heretics who complain about the rise of the so-called “attention economy”: an internet shaped around the demands of an advertising economy.</p>
<p>These refuseniks are rarely founders or chief executives, who have little incentive to deviate from the mantra that their companies are making the world a better place. Instead, they tend to have worked a rung or two down the corporate ladder: designers, engineers and product managers who, like Rosenstein, several years ago put in place the building blocks of a digital world from which they are now trying to disentangle themselves. “It is very common,” Rosenstein says, “for humans to develop things with the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative consequences.”</p>
<p>Rosenstein, who also helped create Gchat during a stint at Google, and now leads a <a href=""https://asana.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">San Francisco-based company</a> that improves office productivity, appears most concerned about the psychological effects on people who, <a href=""https://blog.dscout.com/mobile-touches"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">research shows</a>, touch, swipe or tap their phone 2,617 times a day.</p>
<p>There is growing concern that as well as addicting users, technology is contributing toward so-called “continuous partial attention”, severely limiting people’s ability to focus, and possibly lowering IQ. <a href=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">One recent study</a> showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”</p>

<p>But those concerns are trivial compared with the devastating impact upon the political system that some of Rosenstein’s peers believe can be attributed to the rise of social media and the attention-based market that drives it.</p>
<p>Drawing a straight line between addiction to social media and political earthquakes like Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, they contend that digital forces have completely upended the political system and, left unchecked, could even render democracy as we know it obsolete.</p>
<p>In 2007, Rosenstein was one of a small group of Facebook employees who decided to create a path of least resistance – a single click – to “send little bits of positivity” across the platform. Facebook’s “like” feature was, Rosenstein says, “wildly” successful: engagement soared as people enjoyed the short-term boost they got from giving or receiving social affirmation, while Facebook harvested valuable data about the preferences of users that could be sold to advertisers. The idea was soon copied by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Twitter</a>, with its heart-shaped “likes” (previously star-shaped “favourites”), Instagram, and countless other apps and websites.</p>
<p>It was Rosenstein’s colleague, Leah Pearlman, then a product manager at Facebook and on the team that created the Facebook “like”, who announced the feature in a 2009 blogpost. Now 35 and an illustrator, Pearlman confirmed via email that she, too, <a href=""https://www.theringer.com/2017/2/15/16038024/how-the-like-button-took-over-the-internet-ebe778be2459"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">has grown disaffected</a> with Facebook “likes” and other addictive feedback loops. She has installed a web browser plug-in to eradicate her Facebook news feed, and hired a social media manager to monitor her Facebook page so that she doesn’t have to.</p>

<p>“One reason I think it is particularly important for us to talk about this now is that we may be the last generation that can remember life before,” Rosenstein says. It may or may not be relevant that Rosenstein, Pearlman and most of the tech insiders questioning today’s attention economy are in their 30s, members of the last generation that can remember a world in which telephones were plugged into walls. </p>
<p>It is revealing that many of these younger technologists are weaning themselves off their own products, sending their children to elite Silicon Valley schools where iPhones, iPads and even laptops are banned. They appear to be <a href=""https://twitter.com/PaulLewis/status/843126905687621632"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">abiding by a Biggie Smalls lyric</a> from their own youth about the perils of dealing crack cocaine: never get high on your own supply.</p>

<p>One morning in April this year, designers, programmers and tech entrepreneurs from across the world gathered at a conference centre on the shore of the San Francisco Bay. They had each paid up to $1,700 to learn how to manipulate people into habitual use of their products, on a course curated by conference organiser Nir Eyal.</p>
<p>Eyal, 39, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has spent several years consulting for the tech industry, teaching techniques he developed by closely studying how the Silicon Valley giants operate. </p>

<p>“The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions,” Eyal writes. “It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later.” None of this is an accident, he writes. It is all “just as their designers intended”. </p>
<p>He explains the subtle psychological tricks that can be used to make people develop habits, such as varying the rewards people receive to create “a craving”, or exploiting negative emotions that can act as “triggers”. “Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation,” Eyal writes.</p>
<p>Attendees of the 2017 Habit Summit might have been surprised when Eyal walked on stage to announce that this year’s keynote speech was about “something a little different”. He wanted to address the growing concern that technological manipulation was somehow harmful or immoral. He told his audience that they should be careful not to abuse persuasive design, and wary of crossing a line into coercion.</p>
<p>But he was defensive of the techniques he teaches, and dismissive of those who compare tech addiction to drugs. “We’re not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here,” he said. He flashed up a slide of a shelf filled with sugary baked goods. “Just as we shouldn’t blame the baker for making such delicious treats, we can’t blame tech makers for making their products so good we want to use them,” he said. “Of course that’s what tech companies will do. And frankly: do we want it any other way?”</p>

<p>Without irony, Eyal finished his talk with some personal tips for resisting the lure of technology. He told his audience he uses a Chrome extension, called DF YouTube, “which scrubs out a lot of those external triggers” he writes about in his book, and recommended an app called Pocket Points that “rewards you for staying off your phone when you need to focus”. </p>
<p>Finally, Eyal confided the lengths he goes to protect his own family. He has installed in his house an outlet timer connected to a router that cuts off access to the internet at a set time every day. “The idea is to remember that we are not powerless,” he said. “We are in control.”</p>
<p>But are we? If the people who built these technologies are taking such radical steps to wean themselves free, can the rest of us reasonably be expected to exercise our free will?</p>
<p>Not according to Tristan Harris, a 33-year-old former <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Google</a> employee turned vocal critic of the tech industry. “All of us are jacked into this system,” he says. “All of our minds can be hijacked. Our choices are not as free as we think they are.”</p>
<p>Harris, who <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">has been branded</a> “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”, insists that billions of people have little choice over whether they use these now ubiquitous technologies, and are largely unaware of the invisible ways in which a small number of people in Silicon Valley are shaping their lives.</p>
<p>A graduate of Stanford University, Harris studied under BJ Fogg, a behavioural psychologist revered in tech circles for mastering the ways technological design can be used to persuade people. Many of his students, including Eyal, have gone on to prosperous careers in Silicon Valley. </p>

<p>Harris is the student who went rogue; a whistleblower of sorts, he is lifting the curtain on the vast powers accumulated by technology companies and the ways they are using that influence. “A handful of people, working at a handful of technology companies, through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today,” he said at <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_the_manipulative_tricks_tech_companies_use_to_capture_your_attention"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">a recent TED talk</a> in Vancouver.</p>
<p>“I don’t know a more urgent problem than this,” Harris says. “It’s changing our democracy, and it’s changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships that we want with each other.” Harris went public – giving talks, writing papers, meeting lawmakers and campaigning for reform after three years struggling to effect change inside Google’s Mountain View headquarters.</p>
<p> It all began in 2013, when he was working as a product manager at Google, and circulated a thought-provoking memo, A Call To Minimise Distraction &amp; Respect Users’ Attention, to 10 close colleagues. It struck a chord, spreading to some 5,000 Google employees, including senior executives who rewarded Harris with an impressive-sounding new job: he was to be Google’s in-house design ethicist and product philosopher. </p>
<p>Looking back, Harris sees that he was promoted into a marginal role. “I didn’t have a social support structure at all,” he says. Still, he adds: “I got to sit in a corner and think and read and understand.”</p>
<p> He explored how LinkedIn exploits a need for social reciprocity to widen its network; how YouTube and Netflix autoplay videos and next episodes, depriving users of a choice about whether or not they want to keep watching; how Snapchat created its addictive Snapstreaks feature, encouraging near-constant communication between its mostly teenage users.</p>

<p>The techniques these companies use are not always generic: they can be algorithmically tailored to each person. An internal Facebook report <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/01/facebook-advertising-data-insecure-teens"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">leaked this year</a>, for example, revealed that the company can identify when teens feel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Such granular information, Harris adds, is “a perfect model of what buttons you can push in a particular person”.</p>
<p>Tech companies can exploit such vulnerabilities to keep people hooked; manipulating, for example, when people receive “likes” for their posts, ensuring they arrive when an individual is likely to feel vulnerable, or in need of approval, or maybe just bored. And the very same techniques can be sold to the highest bidder. “There’s no ethics,” he says. A company paying Facebook to use its levers of persuasion could be a car business targeting tailored advertisements to different types of users who want a new vehicle. Or it could be a Moscow-based troll farm seeking to turn voters in a swing county in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Harris believes that tech companies never deliberately set out to make their products addictive. They were responding to the incentives of an advertising economy, experimenting with techniques that might capture people’s attention, even stumbling across highly effective design by accident.</p>
<p>A friend at Facebook told Harris that designers initially decided the notification icon, which alerts people to new activity such as “friend requests” or “likes”, should be blue. It fit Facebook’s style and, the thinking went, would appear “subtle and innocuous”. “But no one used it,” Harris says. “Then they switched it to red and of course everyone used it.”</p>

<p> That red icon is now everywhere. When smartphone users glance at their phones, dozens or hundreds of times a day, they are confronted with small red dots beside their apps, pleading to be tapped. “Red is a trigger colour,” Harris says. “That’s why it is used as an alarm signal.”</p>
<p>The most seductive design, Harris explains, exploits the same psychological susceptibility that makes gambling so compulsive: variable rewards. When we tap those apps with red icons, we don’t know whether we’ll discover an interesting email, an avalanche of “likes”, or nothing at all. It is the possibility of disappointment that makes it so compulsive.<br/></p>
<p>It’s this that explains how the pull-to-refresh mechanism, whereby users swipe down, pause and wait to see what content appears, rapidly became one of the most addictive and ubiquitous design features in modern technology. “Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” Harris says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.”<br/></p>
<h2><strong><span class=""bullet"">•</span><span class=""bullet"">•</span><span class=""bullet"">•</span></strong></h2>
<p> The designer who created the pull-to-refresh mechanism, first used to update Twitter feeds, is Loren Brichter, widely admired in the app-building community for his sleek and intuitive designs. </p>
<p>Now 32, Brichter says he never intended the design to be addictive – but would not dispute the slot machine comparison. “I agree 100%,” he says. “I have two kids now and I regret every minute that I’m not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in.”</p>
<p>Brichter created the feature in 2009 for Tweetie, his startup, mainly because he could not find anywhere to fit the “refresh” button on his app. Holding and dragging down the feed to update seemed at the time nothing more than a “cute and clever” fix. Twitter acquired Tweetie the following year, integrating pull-to-refresh into its own app. </p>
<p>Since then the design has become one of the most widely emulated features in apps; the downward-pull action is, for hundreds of millions of people, as intuitive as scratching an itch.</p>

</aside>
<p>Brichter says he is puzzled by the longevity of the feature. In an era of push notification technology, apps can automatically update content without being nudged by the user. “It could easily retire,” he says. Instead it appears to serve a psychological function: after all, slot machines would be far less addictive if gamblers didn’t get to pull the lever themselves. Brichter prefers another comparison: that it is like the redundant “close door” button in some elevators with automatically closing doors. “People just like to push it.”</p>
<p>All of which has left Brichter, who has put his design work on the backburner while he focuses on building a house in New Jersey, questioning his legacy. “I’ve spent many hours and weeks and months and years thinking about whether anything I’ve done has made a net positive impact on society or humanity at all,” he says. He has blocked certain websites, turned off push notifications, restricted his use of the Telegram app to message only with his wife and two close friends, and tried to wean himself off Twitter. “I still waste time on it,” he confesses, “just reading stupid news I already know about.” He charges his phone in the kitchen, plugging it in at 7pm and not touching it until the next morning.</p>
<p>“Smartphones are useful tools,” he says. “But they’re addictive. Pull-to-refresh is addictive. Twitter is addictive. These are not good things. When I was working on them, it was not something I was mature enough to think about. I’m not saying I’m mature now, but I’m a little bit more mature, and I regret the downsides.”</p>
<p>Not everyone in his field appears racked with guilt. The two inventors listed on Apple’s patent for “managing notification connections and displaying icon badges” are Justin Santamaria and Chris Marcellino. Both were in their early 20s when they were hired by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Apple</a> to work on the iPhone. As engineers, they worked on the behind-the-scenes plumbing for push-notification technology, introduced in 2009 to enable real-time alerts and updates to hundreds of thousands of third-party app developers. It was a revolutionary change, providing the infrastructure for so many experiences that now form a part of people’s daily lives, from ordering an Uber to making a Skype call to receiving breaking news updates.<br/></p>

<p>But notification technology also enabled a hundred unsolicited interruptions into millions of lives, accelerating the arms race for people’s attention. Santamaria, 36, who now runs a startup after a stint as the head of mobile at Airbnb, says the technology he developed at Apple was not “inherently good or bad”. “This is a larger discussion for society,” he says. “Is it OK to shut off my phone when I leave work? Is it OK if I don’t get right back to you? Is it OK that I’m not ‘liking’ everything that goes through my Instagram screen?” </p>
<p>His then colleague, Marcellino, agrees. “Honestly, at no point was I sitting there thinking: let’s hook people,” he says. “It was all about the positives: these apps connect people, they have all these uses – ESPN telling you the game has ended, or WhatsApp giving you a message for free from your family member in Iran who doesn’t have a message plan.”</p>
<p>A few years ago Marcellino, 33, left the Bay Area, and is now in the final stages of retraining to be a neurosurgeon. He stresses he is no expert on addiction, but says he has picked up enough in his medical training to know that technologies can affect the same neurological pathways as gambling and drug use. “These are the same circuits that make people seek out food, comfort, heat, sex,” he says.</p>
<p>All of it, he says, is reward-based behaviour that activates the brain’s dopamine pathways. He sometimes finds himself clicking on the red icons beside his apps “to make them go away”, but is conflicted about the ethics of exploiting people’s psychological vulnerabilities. “It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product,” he says. “It’s capitalism.”</p>
<p>That, perhaps, is the problem. Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist who benefited from hugely profitable investments in Google and Facebook, has grown disenchanted with both companies, arguing that their early missions have been distorted by the fortunes they have been able to earn through advertising. </p>

<p>He identifies the advent of the smartphone as a turning point, raising the stakes in an arms race for people’s attention. “Facebook and Google assert with merit that they are giving users what they want,” McNamee says. “The same can be said about tobacco companies and drug dealers.”</p>
<p>That would be a remarkable assertion for any early investor in Silicon Valley’s most profitable behemoths. But McNamee, 61, is more than an arms-length money man. Once an adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, 10 years ago McNamee introduced the Facebook CEO to his friend, Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive who had overseen the company’s advertising efforts. Sandberg, of course, became chief operating officer at Facebook, transforming the social network into another advertising heavyweight. </p>
<p>McNamee chooses his words carefully. “The people who run Facebook and Google are good people, whose well-intentioned strategies have led to horrific unintended consequences,” he says. “The problem is that there is nothing the companies can do to address the harm unless they abandon their current advertising models.”</p>

<p>But how can Google and Facebook be forced to abandon the business models that have transformed them into two of the most profitable companies on the planet?</p>
<p>McNamee believes the companies he invested in should be subjected to greater regulation, including new anti-monopoly rules. In Washington, there is growing appetite, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/tech-industry-washington-google-amazon-apple-facebook"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">on both sides of the political divide</a>, to rein in Silicon Valley. But McNamee worries the behemoths he helped build may already be too big to curtail. “The EU recently penalised Google $2.42bn for anti-monopoly violations, and Google’s shareholders just shrugged,” he says.</p>
<p>Rosenstein, the Facebook “like” co-creator, believes there may be a case for state regulation of “psychologically manipulative advertising”, saying the moral impetus is comparable to taking action against fossil fuel or tobacco companies. “If we only care about profit maximisation,” he says, “we will go rapidly into dystopia.”<br/></p>

<p>James Williams does not believe talk of dystopia is far-fetched. The ex-Google strategist who built the metrics system for the company’s global search advertising business, he has had a front-row view of an industry he describes as the “largest, most standardised and most centralised form of attentional control in human history”.</p>
<p>Williams, 35, left Google last year, and is on the cusp of completing a PhD at Oxford University exploring the ethics of persuasive design. It is a journey that has led him to question whether democracy can survive the new technological age.</p>
<p>He says his epiphany came a few years ago, when he noticed he was surrounded by technology that was inhibiting him from concentrating on the things he wanted to focus on. “It was that kind of individual, existential realisation: what’s going on?” he says. “Isn’t technology supposed to be doing the complete opposite of this?”<br/></p>
<p>That discomfort was compounded during a moment at work, when he glanced at one of Google’s dashboards, a multicoloured display showing how much of people’s attention the company had commandeered for advertisers. “I realised: this is literally a million people that we’ve sort of nudged or persuaded to do this thing that they weren’t going to otherwise do,” he recalls.</p>
<p>He embarked on several years of independent research, much of it conducted while working part-time at Google. About 18 months in, he saw the Google memo circulated by Harris and the pair became allies, struggling to bring about change from within.</p>

<p> Williams and Harris left Google around the same time, and co-founded an advocacy group, <a href=""http://www.timewellspent.io/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Time Well Spent</a>, that seeks to build public momentum for a change in the way big tech companies think about design. Williams finds it hard to comprehend why this issue is not “on the front page of every newspaper every day. </p>
<p>“Eighty-seven percent of people wake up and go to sleep with their smartphones,” he says. The entire world now has a new prism through which to understand politics, and Williams worries the consequences are profound.</p>
<p>The same forces that led tech firms to hook users with design tricks, he says, also encourage those companies to depict the world in a way that makes for compulsive, irresistible viewing. “The attention economy incentivises the design of technologies that grab our attention,” he says. “In so doing, it privileges our impulses over our intentions.” </p>
<p>That means privileging what is sensational over what is nuanced, appealing to emotion, anger and outrage. The news media is increasingly working in service to tech companies, Williams adds, and must play by the rules of the attention economy to “sensationalise, bait and entertain in order to survive”.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the wake of Donald Trump’s stunning electoral victory, many were quick to question the role of so-called “fake news” on Facebook, Russian-created Twitter bots or the data-centric targeting efforts that companies such as Cambridge Analytica used to sway voters. But Williams sees those factors as symptoms of a deeper problem. </p>
<p>It is not just shady or bad actors who were exploiting the internet to change public opinion. The attention economy itself is set up to promote a phenomenon like Trump, who is masterly at grabbing and retaining the attention of supporters and critics alike, often by exploiting or creating outrage.</p>
<p>Williams was making this case before the president was elected. <a href=""http://quillette.com/2016/10/03/the-clickbait-candidate/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">In a blog published a month before the US election</a>, Williams sounded the alarm bell on an issue he argued was a “far more consequential question” than whether Trump reached the White House. The reality TV star’s campaign, he said, had heralded a watershed in which “the new, digitally supercharged dynamics of the attention economy have finally crossed a threshold and become manifest in the political realm”.</p>

</div>

</aside>
<p>Williams saw a similar dynamic unfold months earlier, during the Brexit campaign, when the attention economy appeared to him biased in favour of the emotional, identity-based case for the UK leaving the European Union. He stresses these dynamics are by no means isolated to the political right: they also play a role, he believes, in the unexpected popularity of leftwing politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, and the frequent outbreaks of internet outrage over issues that ignite fury among progressives. </p>
<p>All of which, Williams says, is not only distorting the way we view politics but, over time, may be changing the way we think, making us less rational and more impulsive. “We’ve habituated ourselves into a perpetual cognitive style of outrage, by internalising the dynamics of the medium,” he says.<br/></p>
<p>It is against this political backdrop that Williams argues the fixation in recent years with the surveillance state fictionalised by George Orwell may have been misplaced. It was another English science fiction writer, Aldous Huxley, who provided the more prescient observation when he warned that Orwellian-style coercion was less of a threat to democracy than the more subtle power of psychological manipulation, and “man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions”.</p>
<p>Since the US election, Williams has explored another dimension to today’s brave new world. If the attention economy erodes our ability to remember, to reason, to make decisions for ourselves – faculties that are essential to self-governance – what hope is there for democracy itself?</p>
<p> “The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will,” he says. “If politics is an expression of our human will, on individual and collective levels, then the attention economy is directly undermining the assumptions that democracy rests on.” If Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat are gradually chipping away at our ability to control our own minds, could there come a point, I ask, at which democracy no longer functions?</p>
<p> “Will we be able to recognise it, if and when it happens?” Williams replies. “And if we can’t, then how do we know it hasn’t happened already?”</p>

  <h1 class=""post-title"">Growing Into Non-Deterministic User Interfaces</h1>
  <span class=""post-date"">07 Oct 2017</span>
  <hr/>
  <p>I found myself scrolling through the Home section of the YouTube app the other day. I usually go straight to my subscriptions, but I happened to be running dry on subscription videos. So I decided to browse through what the YouTube algorithms had to recommend for me, and also through the trending list that day.</p>

<p>As I was scrolling through, I noticed a widget. It contained three video thumbnails from the same channel, placed horizontally, and it was labeled “Rising Creator”. I had never seen this widget before. I scrolled past it.</p>



<p>Everyone writes about how the web is growing up and becoming more personalized by the day. Targeted advertising is making everyone’s surfing experience tailored to them. Human-assisted learning algorithms are helping people decide which outfit works better on them. Music streaming services are sifting through record shelves and popularity charts, and not just surfacing vague recommendations, but confidently curating them into playlists.</p>

<p>Amidst the slowly maturing algorithmically customized dynamic experiences, Internet services are seeing another, more subtle shift. One which has to do with the way these experiences are <em>iterated</em> upon.</p>

<p>We are stepping into the world of constantly evolving, and therefore unpredictable user experiences.</p>

<h2 id=""huh"">Huh?</h2>

<p>Think of a popular online service that you use that is developed by a recently founded (~5 years) startup. Now think about the various design and branding changes they have made over time. If you were an early adopter of Snapchat, think about the evolution of the Stories screen.</p>

<p>That’s the kind of trend I’m getting at.</p>

<p>As I see it, this trend is a side effect of a few other trends that we’ve been seeing lately.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Algorithmically customized experiences:</strong> As we get better at predicting what users want on the fly, we build user interfaces that can mold themselves to fit these predictions. Consider the YouTube example from the top of this article as an example. It’s a proactive UI element that appears when needed, instead of a permanent fixture somewhere that the user subconsciously learns to ignore.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous delivery:</strong> Developers have been moving toward continuous delivery/deployment systems in software development for a while now. Meaning they ship new code on fuzzy schedules. Consider about all the apps that you use that get updates every week. Notice how they often have unclear release notes. This is likely because automatic updates are turned on by default (users don’t see changelogs), and developers don’t have much reason to keep track of changes made in their workflows just to write meaningful changelogs.</li>
  <li><strong>Experimental approaches to UX design:</strong> The commonplaceness of changes delivered through CD pipelines and automatic updates makes it viable for developers to run rolling A/B tests in apps. These tests allow for behavior-centric software development cycles. Software teams use these on a rolling basis to determine which bits of UI they need to iterate upon. It’s a pretty elegant feedback loop, really.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""/assets/per-component-continuous-delivery.png"" alt=""""/></p>

<p>All this has culminated in a climate where users <em>expect</em> their online experiences to change over time. I’d say most people are at least <em>comfortable</em> with the idea at this point. Think back to the time when Facebook was in early stages. As the service scaled up, it would make sweeping design refreshes across the entire platform. In the last few years, however, we have barely seen any large scale renovations of this sort. As the company has grown, it has adopted the practice of continuously tweaking features separately, frequently and almost imperceptibly.</p>

<h2 id=""navigating-blind-with-vuis"">Navigating Blind With VUIs</h2>

<p>One area where the effects of experimentation and rapid delivery are quite evident is the fledgling market of voice user interfaces (VUIs). Siri’s release in 2011 kicked off a Wild West of cloud-based personal voice assistants. Since then, we have seen various companies tackle the concept in various ways.</p>

<p>As these companies try to figure out what this new industry should really look like, we get a Wild West market of VUIs to choose from.</p>

<p>There is a key difference between graphical interfaces and voice interfaces - users <em>see</em> the parts of GUIs that they never use.</p>

<p>Time for an activity! Pick up your smartphone and look at your home or lock screen where you keep your most used apps. You likely use some of those apps more frequently than others. Yet, every time you go to open one of them, you see neighboring apps. This way, you are aware of all the things your phone <em>can</em> do even if you don’t do those things all the time. Open the settings app. You may tweak a couple of those settings every now and then (wallpaper, for example), but if the OS gets a new layout for the rest of the settings, you will become aware of those changes when you see them in passing.</p>

<p>Voice interfaces are vastly different. Until you tell people what your VUI <em>can</em> do, they *will not figure out all of it. Users do not get reminded of the Alexa skills they have enabled and have ready to go every time they use Alexa for something else, say, finding music. It’s much easier to forget your enabled Alexa skills than the list of apps you have installed on your smartphone.</p>

<p><strong>VUIs must be designed to be navigated blindly.</strong></p>

<p>When a VUI gets updated on a rolling schedule, there is a whole new set of rules to follow. Replacing a GUI element is easy. Users immediately see the shiny new button and can get reacquainted easily. VUI users, however, are blind. They don’t <em>see</em> the replacement voice command the next time they navigate near that feature.</p>

<p><strong>With this I come to the reason I wanted to write this article in the first place…</strong></p>

<h2 id=""making-vuis-non-deterministic"">Making VUIs Non-Deterministic</h2>

<p>I think most of us would like to have sci-fi style conversational digital assistants one day - like Tony Stark’s FRIDAY - that not only helps with day-to-day tasks but is also smart enough to recognize deeper complexities of human language such as context, subtext, humor, sarcasm, and complex intents and imperatives. Modern day digital assistants are clearly nowhere close to that.</p>

<p>Now consider this: <strong>Human interactions are not deterministic.</strong> When you wish your best friend a “good morning”, they don’t reply with the same cheery “good morning” in response every single day. Ask them to look up the weather while packing for a weekend camping trip, and they won’t respond in the same monotone weather information for the weekend. Instead, they will respond with an <em>interpretation</em> of weather data, in context of your camping trip.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>today’s computer interactions <em>are</em> deterministic</strong>. It’s not hard to add randomness to modern graphical interfaces; instead, users don’t <em>want</em> their applications and websites to behave differently every day.</p>

<p>We have never had the need to figure out usable GUIs that are random and playful, so we didn’t. VUIs <em>benefit</em> from randomness. To achieve conversational AI someday, we need to build non-deterministic behavior. We need randomness to make a computer’s responses truly sound human.</p>

<p><img src=""/assets/digital-assistant-balancing-act.png"" alt=""""/></p>

<p>If you happen to be involved in product management for a digital assistant, keep this balancing act in mind as you move towards the inevitable non-deterministic assistant of the future.</p>

<p>A gradual shift <em>without</em> acknowledging these tradeoffs comes with the risk of confusing your current users along the way.</p>

									<p><em>Chino:  “All the banks are scared of the NY rules.”</em></p>
<p>On October 10 a confrontation is scheduled which may significantly affect the future of bitcoin in many parts of the world. And if you’re a crypto freedom advocate anywhere near New York, bitcoin businessman Theo Chino is <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/Article-78-Against-NYDFS/events/238795106/?_cookie-check=EMp7gfm5cqyjAiRz"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">requesting your presence</a> at it.</p>
<p>The New York Supreme Court is to hear arguments in his upstart challenge against the infamous BitLicense. It’s New York’s onerous but velvet-gloved attempt at regulating bitcoin businesses.  Although, as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitLicense"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Wikipedia</a> puts it,  the regulation does not forbid “merchants and consumers that utilize virtual currency solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services or for investment purposes,” it has (also according to Wikipedia) resulted in at least ten bitcoin businesses announcing they would cease doing business in New York. <sup id=""cite_ref-:1_4-1"" class=""reference""/></p>
<p>A French national who nevertheless has deep roots in New York, Chino developed crypto-commerce of his own there.</p>
<p>“I had installed Bitcoin processing in about 150 bodegas in Northern Manhattan and in the Bronx,” Chino writes. “I figured a way to earn their trust… that is why I was under the radar of so many people… and that is what gives me standing to sue.”</p>
<p>Ernest Hancock from <a href=""http://FreedomsPhoenix.com"">FreedomsPhoenix</a> argues that NY authorities probably thought they were going to close the flap before any “uncontrolled people” had entered the golden tent.  Chino, being a small business, may have taken them by surprise.</p>
<p>“I have a bank in a garage,” Chino says, pointing out that this is how Hewlett-Packard got started. “You have to start in the technology world in the garage.”</p>
<p>That is what Chino is standing up for… the ability for crypto businesses to start small and easily do business with banks.  He has challenged the license by mounting an “Article 78” lawsuit. As <a href=""https://www.lawny.org/node/62/article-78-proceedings-%E2%80%93-how-appeal-agency-decision"">LawNY.org</a> puts it, “An Article 78 proceeding is used to appeal the decision of a New York State or local agency to the New York courts.”</p>
<p><strong>Chino writes that his team will be naming these grievances:</strong></p>
<p>“1. Violation of the Separation of Powers Doctrine and Ultra Vires Conduct</p>
<p>Meaning that the legislature did not give NYDFS the authority to regulate bitcoin.</p>
<p>2. Arbitrary and Capricious Regulation</p>
<p>And even if the legislature did, Bitcoin is ridiculously small that is completely arbitrary (like asking a kid to get a CDL license to ride a Big Wheel Tricycle in the event he decides to get on the Interstate.)</p>
<p>3. Federal Preemption</p>
<p>And if it’s OK with two above, then Dodd Franck has since passed and it’s the Fed that can regulate.</p>
<p>4. Violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the New York Constitution</p>
<p>And after all that, what they are asking I disclose is worse that cigarettes.”</p>
<p>At its core, Chino believes this case rests on the question “what is bitcoin?”  He says the New York Department of Financial Services’ argument that it has the authority to “BitLicense” only makes sense if bitcoin is defined as money.  He also says it will affect how and sometimes <em>whether</em> crypto-businesses around the world can exist… because of New York’s leverage over banks elsewhere.  Nevertheless, he says the issue has been under-reported, even in the “crypto press.”</p>
<p>“The big names reporters… are not saying a single word,” he tells <em>Crypto Insider</em> by e-mail, “They reported on the Bitfinex suing the Wells Fargo; but they are not saying a words on my case nor Morpheus case. From the specialized media: about just underneath of the bare minimum.”</p>
<p>Some blockchainers do not consider the BitLicense a major impediment. The pithy bitcoin bull Richard Heart says regulations like the BitLicense actually helped bitcoin by making it practical for Coinbase.com to, as he put it, “easily onboard millions of new people into the system.”</p>
<p>Chino sees a smaller picture.</p>
<p>“Bitcoin is a censorship resistant store of value,” he writes, “and like every one tells me, is that regardless of what the government does so what you are doing is useless.”</p>
<p>“Now, the problem, it is resistant however, now and then, the government is able to break it; and each time the government breaks it, it sweeps all those people into jail (at least those who committed what the government considers illegal).”</p>
<p>“If we don’t fight, we accept that the government will be snooping into our shit and we will always looks into our back to make sure that the government is not monitoring us regardless of what we use Bitcoin for.”</p>
<p>“Bitcoin is not censorship resistant since the government made it illegal to create a business if one doesn’t apply AML/KML rules (know your customer). And if you decide to use it outside AML/KML, the government will target you as someone doing something illegal. That is why (Arizona bitcoiner) Morpheus is in jail.”</p>
<p>He also believes the BitLicense limits the growth of “bit-businesses” all over the world.</p>
<p>“Ask Bitfinex,” he writes, referring to <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchange-bitfinex-sues-wells-fargo-over-bank-transfer-freeze/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this incident</a>.</p>
<p>“Any business that does bitcoin that need a bank, will never get one, because all the banks are scared of the NY rules. Bitfinex transfer had nothing to do with the United States (somewhere in Africa to Taiwan I believe) but the money was frozen in the US. <strong>So it doesn’t matter where you are in the world, the NYS rules will apply to any bank doing business with you.</strong>”</p>
<p>Chino says the impact of a victory for his side would be “restoring the censorship-resistant aspect of crypto because the government will be prevented to establish rules.”</p>
<p>Chino has been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzIuCzat_nk&amp;feature=youtu.be"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">crashing speeches </a>by NY bitcoin regulators…questioning officials on camera. Toward the end of <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQxee58dfWAhXI44MKHQL_AIQQtwIIJjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwfhDknByCqM&amp;usg=AOvVaw2616qJQw8kwg_qlzHCSJeK"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">this video</a> he interrupts the District Attorney.  Others pressure him to pipe down, but both officials do answer at least one of his questions and maintain a calm, respectful demeanor toward the activist.  Chino reports that to his knowledge, no officials have yet attempted to intimidate or retaliate against him.</p>
<p>In one of Tom Clancy’s novels, a politician accidentally cements the legitimacy of an allegedly-illegitimate president by filing a suit against him which names him as…president. Could a Chino victory have its own unintended negative consequences for crypto users?  Could it stem the arguably healthy decentralization process in which promising finance institutions are leaving and avoiding New York?  In attacking flawed local over-regulation by somewhat-accessible, somewhat-limited New York officials – arguing this is at least partly a Federal matter – could it help cement or grow the rule of a much less accountable Power, the central government?</p>
<p>Anything bad is usually possible, but the BitLicense situation is sufficiently stifling that there may not be much to lose by losing <em>it.</em>  As Wikipedia puts it: “… as of January 2017 only three BitLicenses were awarded, multiple applicants also tried to receive it, but were all denied.”  That was after the license had been in effect for over two years.  If U.S. historical precedent is any indication, a defeat for the BitLicense would tend to discourage that type of regulation from spreading to other states.  It would presumably provide a morale boost and a sense that the bitcoin community is now a hardened legal target (somewhat like Apple) capable of peaceably defeating unusually powerful authorities with only a tiny segment of its community engaged.</p>
<p>The practical nature of bitcoin is about more than just price…we already knew drugs went up in price when outlawed/over-regulated… but we simultaneously know that this can make them more dangerous and comes with a massive human cost. Bitcoin prices might benefit from or withstand laws that restrict how people use it. But the little people trading it or looking to start businesses… won’t.</p>
<p>“They should care,” writes Chino.</p>

It covers Inter-Process Communication for the Mill CPU architecture family. The talk assumes a familiarity with aspects of CPU architecture in general and C++ programming in particular.</p><p>The Mill is a new general-purpose architectural family, with an emphasis on secure and inexpensive communication across protection boundaries. The large (page) granularity of protection on conventional architectures makes such communication difficult compared to communication within a protection boundary, such as a function call. As a result, the large granularity has forced communication protocols on conventional architectures into two models: pass-by-sharing (using shared pages), and pass-by-copy (using the OS kernel for files/message passing). Both have drawbacks: sharing requires difficult-to-get-right synchronization, while copy involves kernel transitions as well as the costs of the copy itself.</p><p>The Mill supports both these protocols, for use by legacy code. However, the Mill hardware also supports inter-process communication using the same program protocols as for intra-process communication and function call: pass-by-value, pass-by-copy, pass-by-reference, and pass-by-name, but all without kernel involvement or overhead. The protocols are secure: neither party can see anything of the other except the explicit arguments to the communication. Neither caller nor callee codes need source changes to replace intra-process communication with Mill inter-process argument passing. However, the pass-by-reference protocol may require use of shims to delimit the extent of sharing in some languages. And granularity is no longer an issue: arguments can be of any size down to the byte.</p><p>The talk describes the machinery behind the Mill IPC protocols, together with suggestions as to how the hardware facilities may be integrated with representative language runtime systems such as those found in Linux.</p><p><em>Ivan Godard is CTO and a founder of Mill Computing, Inc., developer of the Mill family of general-purpose CPUs. He has written or led the development team for a dozen compilers, an OS, an OODBMS, and much other software. Ivan has been active in the field of computers since the 1960s.</em></p></div></div></body></html>",1

An 8-bit game world blinks into being: baby blue sky, tessellated stone ground, and in between, a squat, red-suited man standing still — waiting. He’s facing rightward; you nudge him farther in that direction. A few more steps reveal a row of bricks hovering overhead and what looks like an angry, ambulatory mushroom. Another twitch of the game controls makes the man spring up, his four-pixel fist pointed skyward. What now? Maybe try combining <i>nudge-rightward</i> and <i>spring-skyward?</i> Done. Then, a surprise: The little man bumps his head against one of the hovering bricks, which flexes upward and then snaps back down as if spring-loaded, propelling the man earthward onto the approaching angry mushroom and flattening it instantly. Mario bounces off the squished remains with a gentle hop. Above, copper-colored boxes with glowing “?” symbols seem to ask: What now?</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span>This scene will sound familiar to anyone who grew up in the 1980s, but you can watch a much younger player</span><span class=""None""> on </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3FHOyhUn3A""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Pulkit Agrawal’s YouTube channel</span></span></a><span class=""None"">. </span><a href=""https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pulkitag/""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Agrawal</span></span></a><span class=""None"">, a computer science researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, is studying how innate curiosity can make learning an unfamiliar task — like playing Super Mario Bros. for the very first time — more efficient. The catch is that the novice player in Agrawal’s video isn’t human, or even alive. Like Mario, it’s just software. But this software comes equipped with </span><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363""><span>experimental machine-learning algorithms</span></a><span class=""None""> designed by Agrawal and his colleagues </span><a href=""https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pathak/""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Deepak Pathak</span></span></a><span class=""None"">, </span><a href=""https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Alexei A.

<p class=""Body""/><p id=""component-59da1503c6d3c""/>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">“You can think of curiosity as a kind of reward which the agent generates internally on its own, so that it can go explore more about its world,” Agrawal said. This internally generated reward signal is known in cognitive psychology as “intrinsic motivation.” The feeling you may have vicariously experienced while reading the game-play description above — an urge to reveal more of whatever’s waiting just out of sight, or just beyond your reach, just to see what happens — that’s intrinsic motivation. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Humans also respond to extrinsic motivations, which originate in the environment. Examples of these include everything from the salary you receive at work to a demand delivered at gunpoint. Computer scientists apply a similar approach called reinforcement learning to train their algorithms: The software gets “points” when it performs a desired task, while penalties follow unwanted behavior. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""/><p id=""component-59da1503c941b""/>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">But this carrot-and-stick approach to machine learning has its limits, and artificial intelligence researchers are starting to view intrinsic motivation as an important component of software agents that can learn efficiently and flexibly — that is, less like brittle machines and more like humans and animals. Approaches to using intrinsic motivation in AI have taken inspiration from psychology and neurobiology — not to mention decades-old AI research itself, now newly relevant. (“Nothing is really new in machine learning,” said </span><a href=""http://reinhouthooft.github.io/""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Rein Houthooft</span></span></a><span class=""None"">, a research scientist at </span><a href=""https://openai.com/""><span>OpenAI</span></a><span class=""None"">, an independent artificial intelligence research organization.)</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Such agents may be trained on video games now, but the impact of developing meaningfully “curious” AI would transcend any novelty appeal. “Pick your favorite application area and I’ll give you an example,” said Darrell, co-director of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence lab. “At home, we want to automate cleaning up and organizing objects. In logistics, we want inventory to be moved around and manipulated. We want vehicles that can navigate complicated environments and rescue robots that can explore a building and find people who need rescuing. In all of these cases, we are trying to figure out this really hard problem: How do you make a machine that can figure its own task out?” </span></p>
<h2><span class=""None"">The Problem With Points</span></h2>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Reinforcement learning is a big part of what helped Google’s </span><a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/is-alphago-really-such-a-big-deal-20160329/""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>AlphaGo software beat the world’s best human player at Go</span></span></a><span class=""None"">, an ancient and intuitive game long considered invulnerable to machine learning. The details of successfully using reinforcement learning in a particular domain are complex, but the general idea is simple: Give a learning algorithm, or “agent,” a reward function, a mathematically defined signal to seek out and maximize. Then set it loose in an environment, which could be any real or virtual world. As the agent operates in the environment, actions that increase the value of the reward function get reinforced. With enough repetition — and if there’s anything that computers are better at than people, it’s repetition — the agent learns patterns of action, or policies, that maximize its reward function. Ideally, these policies will result in the agent reaching some desirable end state (like “win at Go”), without a programmer or engineer having to hand-code every step the agent needs to take along the way.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">In other words, a reward function is the guidance system that keeps a reinforcement-learning-powered agent locked on target. The more clearly that target is defined, the better the agent performs — that is why many of them are currently tested on old video games, which often provide simple extrinsic reward schemes based on points. (The blocky, two-dimensional graphics are useful, too: Researchers can run and repeat their experiments quickly because the games are relatively simple to emulate.)</span></p>
<p class=""Body""/><p id=""component-59da1503ca5ea""/>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Yet “in the real world, there are no points,” said Agrawal. Computer scientists want to have their creations explore novel environments that don’t come preloaded with quantifiable objectives.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">In addition, if the environment doesn’t supply extrinsic rewards quickly and regularly enough, the agent “has no clue whether it’s doing something right or wrong,” Houthooft said. Like a heat-seeking missile unable to lock onto a target, “it doesn’t have any way of [guiding itself through] its environment, so it just goes haywire.” </span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Moreover, even painstakingly defined extrinsic reward functions that can guide an agent to display impressively intelligent behavior — like AlphaGo’s ability to best the world’s top human Go player — won’t easily transfer or generalize to any other context without extensive modification. And that work must be done by hand, which is precisely the kind of labor that machine learning is supposed to help us sidestep in the first place. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Instead of a battery of pseudo-intelligent agents that can reliably hit specified targets like those missiles, what we really want from AI is more like an internal piloting ability. “You make your own rewards, right?” Agrawal said. “There’s no god constantly telling you ‘plus one’ for doing this or ‘minus one’ for doing that.” </span></p>
<h2><span class=""None"">Curiosity as Co-Pilot</span></h2>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Deepak Pathak never set out to model anything as airily psychological as curiosity in code. “The word ‘curiosity’ is nothing but saying, ‘a model which leads an agent to efficiently explore its environment in the presence of noise,’” said Pathak, a researcher in Darrell’s lab at Berkeley and the lead author of the recent work.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">But in 2016, Pathak was interested in the sparse-rewards problem for reinforcement learning. Deep-learning software, powered by reinforcement learning techniques, had recently made significant gains in </span><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602""><span>playing simple score-driven Atari games</span></a><span class=""None""> like Space Invaders and Breakout. But even slightly more complex games like Super Mario Bros. — which require navigating toward a goal distant in time and space without constant rewards, not to mention an ability to learn and successfully execute composite moves like running and jumping at the same time — were still beyond an AI’s grasp.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Pathak and Agrawal, working with Darrell and Efros, equipped their learning agent with what they call an intrinsic curiosity module (ICM) designed to pull it forward through the game without going haywire (to borrow Houthooft’s term). The agent, after all, has absolutely no prior understanding of how to play Super Mario Bros. — in fact, it’s less like a novice player and more like a newborn infant. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""/><p id=""component-59da1503cb8d8""/>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Indeed, Agrawal and Pathak took inspiration from the work of </span><a href=""http://www.alisongopnik.com/""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Alison Gopnik</span></span></a><span class=""None""> and </span><a href=""http://eccl.mit.edu/people.htm""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Laura Schulz</span></span></a><span class=""None"">, developmental psychologists at Berkeley and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, respectively, who showed that babies and toddlers are naturally drawn to play with objects that surprise them the most, rather than with objects that are useful to achieving some extrinsic goal. “One way to [explain] this kind of curiosity in children is that they build a model of what they know about the world, and then they conduct experiments to learn more about what they don’t know,” Agrawal said. These “experiments” can be anything that generates an outcome which the agent (in this case, an infant) finds unusual or unexpected. The child might start with random limb movements that cause new sensations (known as “motor babbling”), then progress up to more coordinated behaviors like chewing on a toy or knocking over a pile of blocks to see what happens. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">In Pathak and Agrawal’s machine-learning version of this surprise-driven curiosity, the AI first mathematically represents what the current video frame of Super Mario Bros. looks like. Then it predicts what the game will look like several frames hence. Such a feat is well within the powers of current deep-learning systems. But then Pathak and Agrawal’s ICM does something more. It generates an intrinsic reward signal defined by how wrong this prediction model turns out to be. The higher the error rate — that is, the more surprised it is — the higher the value of its intrinsic reward function. In other words, if a surprise is equivalent to noticing when something doesn’t turn out as expected — that is, to being wrong — then Pathak and Agrawal’s system gets rewarded for being surprised. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">This internally generated signal draws the agent toward unexplored states in the game: informally speaking, it gets curious about what it doesn’t yet know. And as the agent learns — that is, as its prediction model becomes less and less wrong — its reward signal from the ICM decreases, freeing the agent up to maximize the reward signal by exploring other, more surprising situations. “It’s a way to make exploration go faster,” Pathak said.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">This feedback loop also allows the AI to quickly bootstrap itself out of a nearly blank-slate state of ignorance. At first, the agent is curious about any basic movement available to its onscreen body: Pressing right nudges Mario to the right, and then he stops; pressing right several times in a row makes Mario move without immediately stopping; pressing up makes him spring into the air, and then come down again; pressing down has no effect. This simulated motor babbling quickly converges on useful actions that move the agent forward into the game, even though the agent doesn’t know it.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">For example, since pressing down always has the same effect — nothing — the agent quickly learns to perfectly predict the effect of that action, which cancels the curiosity-supplied reward signal associated with it. Pressing up, however, has all kinds of unpredictable effects: Sometimes Mario goes straight up, sometimes in an arc; sometimes he takes a short hop, other times a long jump; sometimes he doesn’t come down again (if, say, he happens to land on top of an obstacle). All of these outcomes register as errors in the agent’s prediction model, resulting in a reward signal from the ICM, which makes the agent keep experimenting with that action. Moving to the right (which almost always reveals more game world) has similar curiosity-engaging effects. The impulse to move up and to the right can clearly be seen in </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3FHOyhUn3A""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Agrawal’s demo video</span></span></a><span class=""None"">: Within seconds, the AI-controlled Mario starts hopping rightward like a hyperactive toddler, causing ever-more-unpredictable effects (like bumping against a hovering brick, or accidentally squishing a mushroom), all of which drive further exploration.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">“By using this curiosity, the agent learns how to do all the things it needs to explore the world, like jump and kill enemies,” explained Agrawal. “It doesn’t even get penalized for dying. But it learns to avoid dying, because not-dying maximizes its exploration. It’s reinforcing itself, not getting reinforcement from the game.”</span></p>
<h2><span class=""None"">Avoiding the Novelty Trap</span></h2>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Artificial curiosity has been a subject of AI research since at least the early 1990s. One way of formalizing curiosity in software centers on novelty-seeking: The agent is programmed to explore unfamiliar states in its environment. This broad definition seems to capture an intuitive understanding of the experience of curiosity, but in practice it can cause the agent to become trapped in states that satisfy its built-in incentive but prevent any further exploration. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">For example, imagine a television displaying nothing but static on its screen. Such a thing would quickly engage the curiosity of a purely novelty-seeking agent, because a square of randomly flickering visual noise is, by definition, totally unpredictable from one moment to the next. Since every pattern of static appears entirely novel to the agent, its intrinsic reward function will ensure that it can never cease paying attention to this single, useless feature of the environment — and it becomes trapped.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">It turns out that this type of pointless novelty is ubiquitous in the kind of richly featured environments — virtual or physical — that AI must learn to cope with to become truly useful. For example, a self-driving delivery vehicle equipped with a novelty-seeking intrinsic reward function might never make it past the end of the block. “Say you’re moving along a street and the wind is blowing and the leaves of a tree are moving,” Agrawal said. “It’s very, very hard to predict where every leaf is going to go. If you’re predicting pixels, these kinds of interactions will cause you to have high prediction errors, and make you very curious. We want to avoid that.”</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Agrawal and Pathak had to come up with a way to keep their agent curious, but not too curious. Predicting pixels — that is, using deep learning and computer vision to model an agent’s visual field in its entirety from moment to moment — makes it hard to filter out potential distractions. It’s computationally expensive, too. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""/><p id=""component-59da1503ccb8f""/>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">So instead, the Berkeley researchers engineered their Mario-playing agent to translate its visual input from raw pixels into an abstracted version of reality. This abstraction incorporates only features of the environment that have the potential to affect the agent (or that the agent can influence). In essence, if the agent can’t interact with a thing, it won’t even be perceived in the first place.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Using this stripped-down “feature space” (versus the unprocessed “pixel space”) not only simplifies the agent’s learning process, it also neatly sidesteps the novelty trap. “The agent can’t get any benefit out of modeling, say, clouds moving overhead, to predict the effects of its actions,” explained Darrell. “So it’s just not going to pay attention to the clouds when it’s being curious. The previous versions of curiosity — at least some of them — were really only considering pixel-level prediction. Which is great, except for when you suddenly pass a very unpredictable but very boring thing.”</span></p>
<h2><span class=""None"">The Limits of Artificial Curiosity</span></h2>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Darrell conceded that this model of curiosity isn’t perfect. “The system learns what’s relevant, but there’s no guarantee it’ll always get it right,” he said. Indeed, the agent makes it only about halfway through the first level of Super Mario Bros. before getting trapped in its own peculiar local optimum. “There’s this big gap which the agent has to jump across, which requires executing 15 or 16 continuous actions in a very, very specific order,” Agrawal said. “Because it is never able to jump this gap, it dies every time by going there. And when it learns to perfectly predict this outcome, it stops becoming curious about going any further in the game.” (In the agent’s defense, Agrawal notes that this flaw emerges because the AI can press its simulated directional controls only in discrete intervals, which makes certain moves impossible.)</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Ultimately, the problem with artificial curiosity is that even researchers who have studied intrinsic motivation for years still can’t precisely define what curiosity is. </span><a href=""http://vision.psych.umn.edu/users/schrater/PaulSchrater.htm""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Paul Schrater</span></span></a><span class=""None"">, a neuroscientist who leads the Computational Perception and Action Lab at the University of Minnesota, said that the Berkeley model “is the most intelligent thing to do in the short term to get an agent to automatically learn a novel environment,” but he thinks it has less to do with “the intuitive concept of curiosity” than with motor learning and control. “It’s controlling things that are beneath cognition, and more in the details of what the body does,” he said. </span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">To Schrater, the Berkeley team’s novel idea comes in attaching their intrinsic curiosity module to an agent that perceives Super Mario Bros. as a feature space rather than as sequential frames of pixels. He argues that this approach may roughly approximate the way our own brains “extract visual features that are relevant for a particular kind of task.”</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">Curiosity may also require an agent to be at least somewhat embodied (virtually or physically) within an environment to have any real meaning, said </span><a href=""http://www.pyoudeyer.com/""><span class=""Hyperlink1""><span>Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</span></span></a><span class=""None"">, a research director at Inria in Bordeaux, France. Oudeyer has been creating computational models of curiosity for over a decade. He pointed out that the world is so large and rich that an agent can find surprises everywhere. But this isn’t itself enough. “If you’ve got a disembodied agent using curiosity to explore a large feature space, its behavior is going to just end up looking like random exploration because it doesn’t have any constraints on its actions,” Oudeyer said. “The constraints of, for example, a body enable a simplification of the world.” They focus the attention and help to guide exploration.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">But not all embodied agents need intrinsic motivation, either — as the history of industrial robotics makes clear. For tasks that are simpler to specify — say, shuttling cargo from place to place using a robot that follows a yellow line painted on the floor — adding curiosity to the mix would be machine-learning overkill.</span></p>
<p class=""Body""/><p id=""component-59da1503cdb31""/>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">“You could just give that kind of agent a perfect reward function — everything it needs to know in advance,” Darrell explained. “We could solve that problem 10 years ago. But if you’re putting a robot in a situation that can’t be modeled in advance, like disaster search-and-rescue, it has to go out and learn to explore on its own. That’s more than just mapping — it has to learn the effects of its own actions in the environment. You definitely want an agent to be curious when it’s learning how to do its job.”</span></p>
<p class=""Body""><span class=""None"">AI is often informally defined as “whatever computers can’t do yet.” If intrinsic motivation and artificial curiosity are methods for getting agents to figure out tasks that we don’t already know how to automate, then “that’s something I’m pretty sure we’d want any AI to have,” said Houthooft, the OpenAI researcher. “The difficulty is in tuning it.” Agrawal and Pathak’s Mario-playing agent may not be able to get past World 1-1 on its own. But that’s probably what tuning curiosity — artificial or otherwise — will look like: a series of baby steps.</span></p>

 <p>Iceman Wim Hof, is best known for his astounding feats of cold endurance. He currently holds 26 world records, such as remaining in ice for 1 hour and 52 minutes and running up Mount Everest in a pair of shorts.</p>

<p>Recently he has shot into the limelight for his media attention and his <a href=""https://www.wimhofmethod.com/video-course-fundamentals?tap_a=24315-f78a22&amp;tap_s=67992-cf3787"">10-week video course</a> that teaches ordinary people how to learn his techniques.</p>
<p><strong>But is there more to The Iceman than ice? </strong></p>
<p>That’s what I intended to find out when I began listening to Wim’s podcasts and reading through his interview archives.</p>
<p>Below I will present my argument that Iceman Wim Hof really is superhuman, even without his feats of cold endurance.</p>
<p>Some of the things Wim claims below may sound hard to believe. But before you call him a charlatan or a liar, remember that he has a proven track record of staying true to his crazy word, even under the scrutiny of science.</p>
<h3>1) Wim learned to speak 10 languages, without using <a href=""https://www.duolingo.com/"">Duolingo</a> once</h3>
<p>In Wim’s <a href=""https://tim.blog/2015/09/07/the-iceman-wim-hof/"">interview with Tim Ferriss</a>, Wim revealed that he learned to speak 10 languages. Tim, himself a language hacker, was curious to know Wim’s elaborate system for learning so many languages and asked how he did it. Wim’s answer was quite surprising:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just be open and love to learn, and that’s it. I had no real teachers. You know, people in the street and sometimes I had to look for a teacher like a Japanese teacher here in Amsterdam. And a Hindu teacher. So yeah, I was just interested. If you are interested in life, you get to know. And you never stop learning because you love it.</p></blockquote>
<h3>2) He raised his four children single handedly</h3>
<p>While Wim is a positive, carefree Iceman, his life has not been without terrible tradgedy. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6XKcsm3dKs"">this video</a> Wim explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Four children I had with my wife, and I was to be with her forever. She was the love of my life. She died. She suicided. It’s a black hole within yourself. It breaks your heart, and you don’t know why. But the train of daily life is going on, and you’ve gotta catch up otherwise you lose it. So I had to be there for my children. And yes, we created a new nest. My children made me survive in that time, but nature healed my wounds.</p></blockquote>
<p>This left Wim to raise his children, some of them very young, single handedly. In my opinion, this is perhaps the most impressive feat on this list.</p>
<h3>3) He is willing to get injected with malaria for science</h3>
<p>In Wim’s interview with Joe Rogan, Joe asked, “You’re able to deal with malaria?”</p>
<p>Wim’s response: <strong>“Absolutely, man, I’m open for any research and investigation.”</strong></p>
<p><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2NtdOKn630?start=4568&amp;feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen="""">VIDEO</iframe></p>
<h3>4) Wim can hold his breath for about 10 minutes</h3>
<p><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-454004 size-full"" src=""http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-19-at-18.42.24-1.png"" alt=""Iceman wim hof can hold his breath for 10 minutes"" srcset=""http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-19-at-18.42.24-1.png 357w, http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-19-at-18.42.24-1-300x124.png 300w, http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-19-at-18.42.24-1-100x41.png 100w"" sizes=""(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px""/></p>

<h3>6) Iceman Wim had intense surgery and recovered without taking anti-biotics… after giving himself an enema with a fountain jet</h3>
<p>In the “BecomingTheIceman” subreddit, a user asked how Wim got the scar over his belly button. He received this reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>About fifteen years ago Wim was swimming at a fountain in Amsterdam and decided to give himself an enema on the nozzle of the jet. He says he has done it before, but a few weeks earlier the city altered the jet to have a more powerful spout. So when he sat on the hose the water cut through his colon and intestines like a water knife. His son Michael (who he was meeting at the park) took him to the ER. Wim has pretty good ability to resist pain so the hospital did not triage him to surgery immediately because they didn’t understand how serious the injury was. After a few hours he fainted and they realized how bad it was. The doctors stitched him up but rightly feared the risk of sepsis. It took him a long time to recover. He says that he used no antibiotics during recovery.</p>
<p>How do I know this? I’m scott carney, <a href=""http://amzn.to/2xmV3tb"">author of a book about Wim</a>. I didn’t include this story in the book because how on earth do you tell it and not lose track of the main story?</p></blockquote>
<h3>7) Wim can control his erections at will</h3>
<p>When wim was asked on Reddit, “Are you able to prevent yourself from getting a boner at will?</p>
<p>He responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, of course. Somebody tried to seduce me whilst I was naked outside and she was touching me. When I do my yoga, no one can distract me. I am completely in control.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>I wish I knew Wim in high school. </em></p>

<p><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-454074"" src=""http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dsc0050-709x470.jpg"" alt=""wim hof desert"" srcset=""http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dsc0050-709x470.jpg 709w, http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dsc0050-300x199.jpg 300w, http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dsc0050-768x509.jpg 768w, http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dsc0050-100x66.jpg 100w, http://static.highexistence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/dsc0050.jpg 991w"" sizes=""(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px""/></p>
<h3>9) He is a really friendly human being, despite being mocked for most of his life</h3>
<p>Iceman Wim Hof is a pretty weird dude. I mean this in best possible sense, of course. But he is not your average Joe, and many of the things he claims to do sound more like a magic tricks than a biology experiment.</p>
<p>Now Wim has his hordes of followers who are following <a href=""https://www.wimhofmethod.com/video-course-fundamentals?tap_a=24315-f78a22&amp;tap_s=67992-cf3787"">his incredible method</a> each day, but for most of Wim’s adult life he was ridiculed, mocked, and thought of by the scientific community as either a charlatan or at very best a genetic freak.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that most people who have to endure such hostility and cynicism would turn resentful. This is why it’s so incredibly refreshing that Wim is such a friendly, positive force in the world. His goal is less about showing how amazing he is, and all about empowering others to become healthier, happier, and stronger.</p>

<blockquote><p>I just eat once a day, in the evening, after 6pm. I have done for 38 years, and I’m doing really well, because I know how to bring about energy through better breathing.</p>
<p>— Iceman Wim Hof</p></blockquote>
<h3>11) Wim learned to control his heart rate in university, and it wasn’t even part of his curriculum</h3>
<p>When the reddit user FuttBucker2424 <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3gus17/iama_wim_hof_iceman_ama/cu1mhsw/"">asked Wim</a> when he learned to control his heart rate, Wim replied:</p>
<p><strong>“In university, by measurement.”</strong></p>
<p>Can you picture it? When most students were desperately trying to make their way through an economics textbook, or recover from a grueling hangover, Wim was spending his days learning to control his heart rate.</p>
<p>Good ol’ Wim. Never change.</p>

<h3>13) Wim doesn’t need psychedelics because he can trigger his own DMT gland</h3>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3gus17/iama_wim_hof_iceman_ama/cu1my95/"">Wim’s AMA</a>, he was asked:</p>
<p><em>Hi Wim. Do you or have you ever used any type of drug to find deeper consciousness in order to control your autonomic nervous system?</em></p>
<p>His response:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, not at all. I can trigger my own DMT, a hormone driven from the pineal gland – I know how to get there and can do that all the time. You have a better control over the hormonal system – you don’t need drugs to be drugged by yourself in a natural way.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Bonus: Iceman Wim Hof has an identical twin</h3>
<p>Okay, this is a bonus because it’s not superhuman to have an identical twin. The reason why I’m including it here though is because Wim’s twin can’t do any of the things Wim can. It’s as if mother nature herself gave this man an identical twin to show the world that the stuff Wim <a href=""https://www.wimhofmethod.com/video-course-fundamentals?tap_a=24315-f78a22&amp;tap_s=67992-cf3787"">teaches</a> really works.

You might recall that at Google I/O in 2015, the big G’s experimental Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) team showed off <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/project-jacquard-hands-on-googles-atap-is-putting-sens-1707561678"" rel=""nofollow"">Project Jacquard</a>, a touch sensor technology woven directly into fabric.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=38&amp;v=qObSFfdfe7I"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> In a video published at the time</a>, the project’s founder Ivan Pouprey observed that the structure of fabric is very similar to that of a touchscreen.  ATAP told us then that its initial goal was to find a way to control smartphones with the tech, but of course, the tech could have all kinds of applications. The longer term ambitions, as articulated by Pouprey, amounted to no less than creating fabric-based objects with invisible computing powers.</p><p>In 2015, the tech was still rudimentary, but it was impressive in a tantalizing way. The tech was terrible, but the ideas were great, and the possibilities felt endless. Fast forward to 2017, and the years of R&amp;D have yielded  a $350 Levi’s jean jacket with Jacquard technology sewn in.<br/></p><p>When I first opened the shipping box to check out the jacket, I was pleasantly surprised. This is cute! The future is here! Invisible computer clothing! It looked like a nice quality denim jacket, no circuits or wires to be seen. Then I saw a few-inches long strip of plastic still in the box, and I had to laugh, because, for a second, I had believed that we had finally achieved fashion tech absent of any clunky hardware or haptic feedback or blinking lights. For a second, I was a believer. And then that pesky little hunk of plastic stared up at me as if silently communicating, “you misguided fool.”</p><figure class=""js_marquee-assetfigure align--center""/><p>Of course this thing needs a damn dongle to work. While Google did manage to fulfill its promise in weaving tech into a piece of clothing, similarly to what it demoed two years ago, it still couldn’t fully deliver its vision without a separate piece of hardware. While the touch sensor tech is there, Google still needs to power it. And that’s where the dongle—equipped with a mini computer, Bluetooth radio, and battery—comes in. <br/></p><p>John McCarthy, the head of product at Project Jacquard, told Gizmodo that they could have made the current design of the dongle “a lot smaller” but that it was an intentional design choice in order to “mimic the sort of strap you would naturally see on the cuff of the jacket.” While striving to stay true to Levi’s design element is a loyal effort on Google’s behalf, the hardware could stand to be scaled down. Consciously choosing not to, in my opinion, is dumb. As for whether the tags will ever be invisible, McCarthy said, “We’ll see.” </p><p>And in fairness, it’s not <em>that</em> obtrusive—you can conceal the USB connector under a flap in the sleeve like a dweebie Houdini.  That leaves a sliver of the tag visible along with a glowing light at the tip where it actually plugs into the jacket. It’s pretty inelegant in execution, and it’s certainly not inconspicuous.<br/></p><figure class=""js_marquee-assetfigure align--left""><div class=""img-wrapper lazy-image ""><figcaption>You can customize the gestures on the Jacquard app</figcaption></div></figure><p>Should you submit to the tyranny of dongle and cloth, what you get is a relatively seamless controller for your phone. You can brush or tap or cover a series of threaded lines on the cuff adjacent to the dongle to make your phone do different things, including playing and pausing your music, skipping songs, getting directions, and getting notified when you receive a text. The jacket pairs with your phone through the Jacquard app, which is available for both Android and iOS. Once paired, you are able to set up your interactions, and customize which abilities go with which gestures. </p><p>I will admit, brushing the cuff of my jacket to skip a track on my Spotify playlist was surprisingly exciting. Was it $350 exciting? You bet your dongle it wasn’t. I know. I’ve said dongle a lot. I just want to emphasize that this smart jacket still feels like two independent products—a well-designed jacket and a dongle-cuff hybrid that performs a few functions that are uncomplicated to do from your phone, a set of headphones, or a smartwatch. And because the app needs to be running and the dongle connected to your phone’s Bluetooth to work, it’s a total battery suck.<br/></p><figure class=""js_marquee-assetfigure align--right""/><p>There is certainly potential here. To Google I say, keep iterating. As it stands, this smart jacket feels more like an exceptionally cool R&amp;D project than a product you should spend your money on. That thrilling tingle I felt when my music changed at the touch of my cuff signals its promise, but in its current form, it’s too expensive, doesn’t perform enough functions to really make your life that much easier, and is a battery drain on your phone. I’m not writing off the future for smart jackets, but for now it’s nothing but a stylish gimmick<strong>. </strong></p><h3><strong>README</strong></h3><ul><li>Cute jacket, ugly dongle</li><li>$350 is too expensive</li><li>Nothing quite like running late because you have to CHARGE YOUR JACKET</li></ul></div></div></body></html>",1

      <p>The demand for programmers is high, and growing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, software developer jobs are expected to grow 17% from 2014 till 2024. They categorize this growth as “much faster” than the average rate among other professions.”</em>  <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/01/20/will-the-demand-for-developers-continue-to-increase/#43f9088533ee"">Forbes 2017</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The supply of programmers is well behind the demand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“In an average month, there were 115,058 unique job postings for software developers and 33,579 actually hired. This means there was approximately 1 hire for every 3 unique job postings.”</em> – <a href=""http://www.economicmodeling.com/2017/06/01/labor-market-supply-demand-software-developers/"">Emsi 2017</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why then is the industry ignoring nearly 50% of the population?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“92.1 percent of the respondents to Stack Overflow’s 2015 developer survey identified as male; only 5.8 percent identified as female. (The remaining respondents either chose “other” or declined to answer.) The survey was conducted online in February, using ads placed on Stack Overflow, and included respondents from 157 countries.”</em> – <a href=""https://splinternews.com/survey-says-92-percent-of-software-developers-are-men-1793846921"">Splinter 2015</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could this be a clue?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Computer Science and Engineering majors have stagnated at less than 10% of all degrees conferred [to women] in the U.S. for the past decade, while the demand for employees with programming and engineering skills continue to outpace the supply every year”</em> – <a href=""http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/"">Randal S. Olson 2014</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The share of computer science majors who are women also has been in a near constant decline since the early 1980s, with women representing about 15 percent of computer science majors in 2011.”</em> – <a href=""https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/04/21/study-measures-causes-gender-gap-computer-science"">Inside Higher Ed 2015</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is made all the more poignant given that women outnumber men in college by 2:1.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Although college enrollment has increased, the ratio of male to female students is nearly 1:2 “</em> – <a href=""https://www.newsmax.com/US/women-men-college-students/2017/06/05/id/794317/"">Denver Post 2017</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, even though twice and many women enroll in college than men, fifteen times as many men become programmers than women.</p>

<p>This ratio is much worse than the CS graduation rates.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 812,669 bachelors degrees earned by men in 2015, 48,840 (6%) were in Computer science.  <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_322.40.asp"">NCES</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of the 1,082,265 bachelors degrees earned by women in 2015, 10,741 (1%) were in Computer Science <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_322.50.asp"">NCES</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So five times as many men than women graduate with BSCS degrees.  Then, nearly two out of three of those women do not pursue a programming career.</p>

<p>I gave a keynote talk to several hundred programmers recently.  I asked all the programmers to stand up; and then asked all the men to sit down.  A paucity of people remained standing.  Perhaps one in twenty.</p>

<p>I don’t want to overstate it; but that’s a significant signal. The question is, what does it signify and what can be done about it?</p>

<p>The question is not an idle one.  The demand for programmers is not going to abate.  We are going to need more and more programmers over the next several decades.  The lack of supply is going to drive salaries higher and higher. You’d think that massive numbers of young people, both men and women, would be lining up. And yet most women are not.  Why not?</p>

<p>I have pair programmed with women who coded rings around me.  I <em>know</em> women can code.  So why do so many who graduate in CS take another direction.  And why do so many entering college fail to consider the career?</p>

<p>Is it possible that women are being actively rejected by the job market?  Given the high demand and the low supply, that possibility seems absurd.  Businesses that are starved for programmers can’t afford to filter based on gender.  They can’t afford to filter based on anything except merit[1], and they’ll have to compete for that.  What’s more, there are many employers who have engaged in outreach programs specifically aimed at recruiting minorities and women.  So, whatever it is that is shunting women away from becoming or remaining programmers, it’s difficult to believe that it’s a hiring policy.</p>

<p>Is it possible that women are being actively resisted by the colleges?  In a student body that is dominated 2:1 by women, you’d think a problem like that would be resolved very quickly.  No institution is going to want to alienate two thirds of it’s paying clients.  Any institution that did, would find itself in deep financial trouble very quickly.</p>

<p>If a plurality women students expressed interest in computer science, the universities would bend over backwards to accommodate them.  In fact, they are bending over backwards to accommodate them.  Or at least <a href=""http://www.bestcollegesonline.com/blog/the-10-best-colleges-for-females-in-stem-fields/"">some</a> are.  The rest are certainly very concerned.</p>

<p>Some researchers think the problem is really in high school.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Researchers found that computing appeal for girls peaks in middle school, where having an inspiring teacher and thinking that coding is “for girls” are instrumental in sparking interest. The appeal dips in high school in what researchers call the “high school trap” because of a lack of friends in coding classes or the lack of those classes at all.”</em> – <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/data-mine/articles/2016-10-20/study-computer-science-gender-gap-widens-despite-increase-in-jobs"">USNews 2016</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can envision this as a pipeline of potential programmers.  This pipeline begins in primary school or before, and wends its way through middle school, high school, college, early internships and jobs, and finally to careers.  Somewhere along this pipeline, and perhaps at many places, women are shunted aside.</p>

<p>That shunt may be very early indeed.  As Maggie Johnson, Director of Education and University Relations at (<em>ironically</em>) Google, says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“It’s important to note that there are no biological or cognitive reasons that justify a gender disparity in individuals participating in computing (Hyde 2006). With similar training and experience, women perform just as well as men in computer-related activities (Margolis 2003). But there can be important differences in reinforced predilections and interests during childhood that affect the diversity of those choosing to pursue computer science.</em> 
<br/><br/>
<em>In general, most young boys build and explore; play with blocks, trains, etc.; and engage in activity and movement. For a typical boy, a computer can be the ultimate toy that allows him to pursue his interests, and this can develop into an intense passion early on. Many girls like to build, play with blocks, etc. too. For the most part, however, girls tend to prefer social interaction. Most girls develop an interest in computing later through social media and YouTubers, girl-focused games, or through math, science and computing courses. They typically do not develop the intense interest in computing at an early age like some boys do – they may never experience that level of interest (Margolis 2003).”</em> – <a href=""https://research.googleblog.com/2015/07/the-computer-science-pipeline-and.html"">Google Research Blog 2015</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Director Johnson’s notion is, to put it very simply, that women tend not to be as interested in programming as men because, as very young girls, they prefer different forms of play.</p>

<p>Whether she is correct or not is a matter of some debate.  However, it would appear that there are potential shunts all along the pipeline, from the very start to the very end.  How can we remove those shunts?</p>

<p>There seems to me to be little downside in encouraging young girls and young women to consider programming as an entertaining activity, something fun to learn, and eventually a good career.  This could be undertaken by parents, schools, and employers using various educational and public outreach programs.  I also think that the boot-camp idea has merit, especially as an alternative to university.  All these mechanisms help to unclog the upstream portions of the pipeline, where it will do the most good.</p>

<p>Is there a way to increase the demand?  After all, as demand increases so do salaries.  Won’t this attract women into the industry?  Unfortunately this is the strategy we have been using for the last few decades, and it does not seem to be working.  In fact, despite the increase in demand, and in salaries, the trend for women seems to be going in the opposite direction. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html"">HuffPost 2015</a></p>

<p>What about hiring quotas?  Will they help to unclog the pipeline?  The theory of a quota program might be that it artificially increases the demand for women.  But, again, demand isn’t the problem.  It’s already sky high and rising.</p>

<p>What quotas will do, however, is to redirect women into those companies that employ quotas, and redirect men into those companies that do not.   Let’s imagine a scenario.</p>

<p>Assume that there are two sets of employers.  Set G represents the big, high profile, companies who hire 10% of all programmers.  They have big beautiful buildings, and lavish work areas.  They have all the glitz and glitter we have come to expect of big software companies.  They attract the best and brightest; and can keep them.  Resumes and candidates flood into G; but only a few make the cut.  If G’s demand is not sated, it is only because G keeps their standards very high.</p>

<p>Set R represents all the rest.  These are small to medium sized employers who need programmers just as much as G does, but have to fight much harder to get the best people.  Resumes and candidates do not flood into R.  Instead, R must pay search firms and employment agencies for resumes.  They seldom see the best of the best.</p>

<p>Now let’s use the numbers from above, rounded for convenience.  In 2015 there were 50,000 men, and 10,000 women who graduated with BSCS degrees.  G will hire 10% or 6,000 of them; 1,000 women, and 5,000 men.  R will hire the remaining 9,000 women, and 45,000 men.  G will choose the top decile from the batch.  R will draw from the rest.</p>

<p>Now clearly I am making a lot of assumptions here.  There are many reasons why top decile programmers may not want to work at G.  I have completely bypassed the effect of startups, culture, and location.  Still, as a general principle, we should expect that G will succeed in hiring a disproportionate number of the top decile.</p>

<p>I am also assuming that programmers can be divided up by a single performance dimension and assigned into deciles.  This is clearly simplistic.  There are many dimensions that an employer will use to select employees to hire.  Still, it should be clear that employers will attempt to rank the acumen of candidates; and choose from among those who rank highest.</p>

<p>The end result of our thought experiment is that G and R will end up with the same ratio of men and women, and that the relative ranking of men and women in each set will be the same.  G gets the 6,000 in the top decile, and R gets the rest.</p>

<p>Now let’s assume that G decides to establish a quota to hire 2,000 women, instead of 1,000.  This necessarily means that they must lower their standards to accept the top two deciles of women, while still maintaining their standards for the top decile of men.  In fact, since they will be hiring fewer than 10% of the available men, they can actually raise their standards for the men.  This means that, on average, men will outperform women in G.</p>

<p>R will hire 8,000 women who rank at the 7th decile and below.  R will also hire 46,000 men who rank from just above the 8th decile and below.  The result is that R will see a lower ratio of women to men (17% instead of 20%), and on average the men will outperform the women.</p>

<p>One argument that can be presented against this analysis is that G will not have to lower it’s standards in order to hire women, because G will be looking at “other factors” that compensate for raw acumen or ability.  Those factors may include culture, personality, etc.</p>

<p>This may indeed be true.  However, regardless of what set of complex criteria G uses to hire more than the normal share of the women, R will have to choose from women that G passed over.</p>

<p>A quota policy may seem to be helping women by offering them a greater chance of employment.  However, at least in this simplistic thought experiment, the net result is to tilt the playing field in favor of men.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>No more women get hired overall, because demand is too high to allow any candidate, male or female, to go unhired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the vast majority of environments (R) women will appear scarcer than they really are, magnifying and reenforcing the male signal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In every environment the women will be working with men who, on average, will outperform them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On top of all that, G will have hired 1,000 employees who fall below their normal standards.  Overall the performance of their staff will be decreased. They must also face the ethical question of bypassing more qualified candidates in favor of gender – which is clearly discriminatory.</p>

<p>So it is difficult to see how a quota program helps anyone at all[2].</p>

<hr/>
<p>[1] I use the term “merit” in the sense of academic or professional achievement.</p>

<p>[2] I am fully aware that this post will generate a fair number of nasty responses.  That’s the way of things in our current polarized environment.  My hope is that it also stimulates some reasoned and civil discourse.  I do not hold that my conclusions are absolutely correct in every regard.  My goal is to learn from others.  So if you can tell me, kindly, and respectfully, where the flaws are in my analysis, I would be grateful.</p>

That lump of goo knows about neutron stars, black holes, neutrinos, and a middling number of the flora and fauna here on planet Earth. It even knows (a little) about itself. That lump of goo has worked out mathematical truths, moral half-truths, and philosophical ambiguities. And from the mud beneath our feet, it extracted all the stuff used to make our great cities, our cars and jets and rockets, and the wires and wireless signals that are turning these disparate lumps of goo into one great hivemind of creativity, knowledge, and sometimes cruelty.</p><p data-reactid=""275"">There can be no argument that our brains are the coolest things ever, because there can be no such argument without those brains. They are the substrate of all argument and discussion. End of discussion.</p><p data-reactid=""276"">So far, at least. One day, other things may be discovered or built that can also discover, create, argue, discuss, cajole, or be cruel. They might land in ships from faraway lands (highly unlikely). They might emerge from a laboratory or a garage (almost certainly). And these new thinking machines will without a doubt surpass the wonder of our lumps of goo. Just as a child grows taller than both parents and reaches new peaks while those parents decline, our creations will take our places as the coolest damn things in the universe. Some argue that this is already true.</p><p data-reactid=""277"">Artificial intelligence is here now. In laboratories all around the world, little AIs are springing to life. Some <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/05/what-deep-blue-tells-us-about-ai-in-2017/"" data-reactid=""279"">play chess better than any human ever has</a>. Some are learning to <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/god-is-a-bot-and-anthony-levandowski-is-his-messenger/"" data-reactid=""281"">drive a million cars a billion miles</a> while saving more lives than most doctors or EMTs will over their entire careers. Some will make sure your dishes are dry and spot-free, or that your laundry is properly fluffed and without wrinkle. Countless numbers of these intelligences are being built and programmed; they are only going to get smarter and more pervasive; they’re going to be better than us, but they’ll never be just like us. And that’s a good thing.</p><p data-reactid=""283"">What separates us from all the other life forms on earth is the degree to which we are self-aware. Most animals are conscious. Many are even self-conscious. But humans are something I like to call hyper-conscious. There’s an amplifier in our brains wired into our consciousnesses, and it goes to 11.</p><p data-reactid=""284"">It goes to 11, and the knob has come off.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""285""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""286""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""287""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""289"">The Origin of Consciousness</h2><p data-reactid=""290""><strong data-reactid=""291"">There isn’t a single day</strong> that a human being becomes self-conscious. You can’t pen the date in a baby book, or take a picture of the moment and share it on Facebook, or celebrate its anniversary for years to come. It happens gradually, in stages. (It often unravels gradually, also in stages.)</p><p data-reactid=""293"">Human consciousness comes on like the old lights that used to hang in school gyms when I was a kid. You flip a switch, and nothing happens at first. There’s a buzz, a dim glow from a bulb here or there, a row that flickers on, shakily at first, and then more lights, a rising hum, before all the great hanging silver cones finally get in on the act and rise and rise in intensity to their full peak a half hour or more later.</p><p data-reactid=""294"">We switch on like that. We emerge from the womb unaware of ourselves. The world very likely appears upside down to us for the first few hours of our lives, until our brains reorient the inverted image created by the lenses of our eyes (a very weird bit of mental elasticity that we can replicate in labs with goggle-wearing adults).</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""295""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""296""/></figure><p data-reactid=""298"">It takes a long while before our hands are seen as extensions of ourselves. Even longer before we realize that we have brains and thoughts separate from other people’s brains and thoughts. Longer still to cope with the disagreements and separate needs of those other people’s brains and thoughts. And for many of us (possibly most), any sort of true self-knowledge and self-enlightenment never happens. Because we rarely pause to reflect on such trivialities. The unexamined life and all that…</p><p data-reactid=""299"">The field of AI is full of people working to replicate or simulate various features of our intelligence. One thing they are certain to replicate is the gradual way that our consciousness turns on. As I write this, the gymnasium is buzzing. A light in the distance, over by the far bleachers, is humming. Others are flickering. Still more are turning on.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""300""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""301""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""302""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""304"">The Holy Gr-ai-l</h2><p data-reactid=""305""><strong data-reactid=""306"">The holy grail of AI research</strong> was established before AI research ever even began. One of the pioneers of computing, Alan Turing, described an ultimate test for “thinking” machines: Could they pass as human? Ever since, humanity has both dreamed of—and had collective nightmares about—a future where machines are more human than humans. Not smarter than humans—which these intelligences already are in many ways. But more neurotic, violent, warlike, obsessed, devious, creative, passionate, amorous, and so on.</p><p data-reactid=""308"">The genre of science fiction is stuffed to the gills with such tales. <a href=""http://amzn.to/2xpVaSA"" target=""_blank"" data-reactid=""310"">A collection of my short works will be released this October</a>, and in it you can see that I have been similarly taken with these ideas about AI. And yet, even as these intelligences outpace human beings in almost every intellectual arena in which they’re entered, they seem no closer to being like us, much less more like us.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""312""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""313""/></figure><p data-reactid=""315"">This is a good thing, but not for the reasons that films such as The Terminator and The Matrix suggest. The reason we haven’t made self-conscious machines is primarily because we are in denial about what makes us self-conscious. The things that make us self-conscious aren’t as flattering as the delusion of ego or the illusion of self-permanence. Self-consciousness isn’t even very useful (which is why research into consciousness rarely goes anywhere—it spends too much time assuming there’s a grand purpose and then searching for it).</p><p data-reactid=""316"">Perhaps the best thing to come from AI research isn’t an understanding of computers, but rather an understanding of ourselves. The challenges we face in building machines that think highlight the various little miracles of our own biochemical goo. They also highlight our deficiencies. To replicate ourselves, we have to first embrace both the miracles and the foibles.</p><p data-reactid=""317"">What follows is a very brief guide on how to build a self-conscious machine, and why no one has done so to date (thank goodness).</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""318""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""319""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""320""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""322"">The Blueprint</h2><p data-reactid=""323""><strong data-reactid=""324"">The blueprint</strong> for a self-conscious machine is simple.

We’ll return to the blueprint later to describe how this algorithm might be programmed.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""333""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""334""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""335""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""337"">What Makes Us Human</h2><p data-reactid=""338""><strong data-reactid=""339"">To understand human consciousness,</strong> one needs to dive deep into the study of Theory of Mind. It’s a shame that this concept is obscure, because it consumes most of our computing power for most of our lives. Our brains have been likened to little more than Theory of Mind machines—almost all of our higher level processing power is shunted into this singular task. So what is Theory of Mind, and why is this topic so rarely discussed if our brains are indeed so obsessed?</p><p data-reactid=""384"">Theory of Mind is the attempt by one brain to ascertain the contents of another brain. It is Sue wondering what in the world Juan is thinking. Sue creates theories about the current state of Juan’s mind. She does this in order to guess what Juan might do next.
If you think about it, no power could possibly be greater for a social and tribal animal like us humans. For thousands and thousands of years we have lived in close proximity, reliant on one another in a way that mimics bees, ants, and termites. As our behaviors and thoughts grew more and more complex, it became crucial for each member of the tribe to have an idea of what the other members were thinking and what actions they might perform. Theory of Mind is intellectual espionage, and we are quite good at it—but with critical limitations that we will get into later.</p><p data-reactid=""387"">Sue guessing what Juan is thinking is known as First Order Theory of Mind. It gets more complex. Sue might also be curious about what Juan thinks of her. This is Second Order Theory of Mind, and it is the root of most of our neuroses and perseverate thinking. “Does Juan think I’m smart?” “Does Juan like me?” “Does Juan wish me harm?” “Is Juan in a good or bad mood because of something I did?”</p><p data-reactid=""388"">Questions like these should sound very, very familiar. We fill our days with them. And that’s just the beginning.</p><p data-reactid=""389"">Third Order Theory of Mind would be for Sue to wonder what Juan thinks Josette thinks about Tom. More simply, does Tom know Josette is into him? Or Sue might wonder what Josette thinks Juan thinks about Sue. Is Josette jealous, in other words? This starts to sound confusing, the listing of several names and all the “thinking about” thrown in there like glue, but this is what we preoccupy our minds with more than any other conscious-level sort of thinking. We hardly stop doing it. We might call it gossip, or socializing, but our brains consider this their main duty—their primary function. There is speculation that Theory of Mind, and not tool use, is the reason for the relative size of our brains in the first place.</p><p data-reactid=""390"">In a world of rocks hurtling through the air, a good use of processing power is to compute trajectories and learn how to avoid getting hit. One develops an innate sense of parabolas, of F=ma, of velocities squared. In a world of humans jostling about, a good use of processing power is to compute where those people might be next, and what they will do when they get there.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""391""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""392""/></figure><p data-reactid=""394"">If this trait is so useful, then why aren’t all animals self-conscious? They very well might be. There’s plenty of research to suggest that many animals display varying degrees of self-consciousness. Animals that know a spot of color on the face in the mirror is in fact on their own heads. Animals that communicate to other animals on how to solve a puzzle so that both get a reward. Even octopi show considerable evidence of being self-conscious. But just as the cheetah is the fastest animal on land, humans are the queens and kings of Theory of Mind.</p><p data-reactid=""395"">I’ve watched my dog observe me expectantly to guess what I might do next. Am I going to throw the stick or not? Am I going to eat that last bite of food or share it? I’ve even seen dogs wrestle with Second Order Theory of Mind questions. Play-wrestling with a partner, the dog has to gauge what my intent is. Have I suddenly turned on the pack? Or is this yet another game? Which side should my dog take? (Dwelling on this example now, I’m ashamed of having put my poor pup into such a heart-pounding conundrum for my own entertainment.)</p><p data-reactid=""396"">Dogs are a good example of Theory of Mind in the animal kingdom, because dogs have evolved over the years to be social with humans and to pick up on our behavioral cues. The development of self-conscious AIs will follow this model closely, as robots have already become our domesticated pals. Some of them are already trying to guess what we’re thinking and what we might do next. There are cars being developed that read our faces to determine where our attention is being directed and whether or not we’re sleepy. This is First Order Theory of Mind, and it is being built into automated machines already on the road.</p><p data-reactid=""397"">Further development of these abilities will not lead to self-consciousness, however. There’s a very simple and elegant reason for this, and it explains the mystery of human consciousness and it provides the blueprint mentioned above for creating self-conscious machines, something we could very easily do in the lab today. But you’ll soon see why this would be a terrible idea. And not the world-ending kind found in dystopic science fiction.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""398""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""399""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""400""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""402"">The Missing Piece</h2><p data-reactid=""403""><strong data-reactid=""404"">The human brain is not a single,</strong> holistic entity. It is a collection of thousands of disparate modules that only barely and rarely interconnect. We like to think of the brain as a computer chip. We might even attempt further precision and think of the brain as a desktop computer, with a central processing unit that’s separate from RAM (short-term memory), the hard drives (long-term memory), cooling fans (autonomous nervous functions), power supplies (digestion), and so on.</p><p data-reactid=""406"">That’s a fun analogy, but it’s incredibly misleading. Computers are well-engineered devices created with a unified purpose. All the various bits were designed around the same time for those same purposes, and they were designed to work harmoniously with one another. None of this in any way resembles the human mind. Not even close.
The human mind is more like Washington, D.C. (or any large government or sprawling corporation). Some functions of the brain were built hundreds of millions of years ago, like the ones that provide power to individual cells or pump sodium-potassium through cell membranes. Others were built millions of years ago, like the ones that fire neurons and make sure blood is pumped and oxygen is inhaled. Move toward the frontal lobe, and we have the modules that control mammalian behaviors and thoughts that were layered on relatively recently.</p><p data-reactid=""440"">Each module in the brain is like a separate building in a congested town. Some of these modules don’t even talk to other modules, and for good measure. The blood-pumping and breath-reflex buildings should be left to their own devices. The other modules are prone to arguing, bickering, disagreeing, subverting one another, spasming uncontrollably, staging coups, freaking the fuck out, and all sorts of other hysterics. Here are a couple of examples.</p><p data-reactid=""443"">A few months ago, my girlfriend and I set out from the Galapagos for the French Polynesians. The 3,000 miles of open sea can take anywhere from two weeks to a month to cross. My girlfriend does not often succumb to seasickness, but in an area of the South Pacific known as the Convergence Zone, a confused sea set our sailboat into a strange and jerky rhythm. She fell prey to a terrible sensation that lasted for a few days.</p><p data-reactid=""444"">Seasickness is a case of our brain modules not communicating with one another (or doing their own thing). When the visual cues of motion from our environment do not match the signals from our inner ears (where we sense balance), our brains assume that we’ve been poisoned. It’s a reasonable assumption for creatures that climb through trees eating all the brightly-colored things. Toxins disrupt our brains’ processing, leading to misfires and bad data. We did not evolve to go to sea, so when motion does not match what we are seeing, our bodies think we’ve lost our ability to balance on two legs. The result is that we empty our stomachs (getting rid of the poison) and we lie down and feel zero desire to move about (preventing us from plummeting to our deaths from whatever high limb we might be swinging from).</p><p data-reactid=""445"">It doesn’t matter that we know this is happening in a different module of our brains, a higher-level processing module. We can know without a doubt that we haven’t been poisoned, but this module is not going to easily win out over the seasickness module. Having been seasick myself, and being very curious about such things, I’ve felt the various modules wrestle with one another. Lying still and sleeping a lot while seasick, I will then jump up and perform various tasks needed of me around the boat—the seasickness practically gone for the moment—only to lie back down once the chore is done. Modules get different priorities based on our environmental stimuli. Our brains are not a holistic desktop PC. To truly watch their analogue in action, turn on C-SPAN or sit in on a contentious corporate board meeting.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""446""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""447""/></figure><p data-reactid=""449"">Another example of our modules in battle with one another: There are some very strong modules inside of us that are programmed to make copies of themselves (and to do that, they need to make copies of us). These are the sex modules, and they have some of the largest and nicest buildings in our internal Washington D.C.s. These modules direct many of our waking hours as we navigate dating scenes, tend to our current relationships, determine what to wear and how to maintain our bodies, and so much more.</p><p data-reactid=""450"">These reproductive modules might fill a woman with the urge to dress up and go dancing. And men with the urge to go to places where women dress up and dance while the men stand at bars drinking. Those modules might even lead some of these people to pair up and go home with one another. And this is where various other modules will intervene with pills, condoms, and other tools designed to subvert the original urges that got the couples together in the first place. However, if those devices are not employed, even though higher-level modules most definitely did not want anyone getting pregnant that night, a lovechild might be born, and other modules will then kick in and flood brains with love and deep connections to assist in the rearing of that child.
Some of our modules want us to get pregnant. Often, stronger modules very much wish to delay this or make sure it’s with the right person. Dormant modules lie in wait to make sure we’re connected with our children no matter what those other hedonistic and unfeeling pricks in those other buildings down the block think.</p><p data-reactid=""451"">Critical to keep in mind here is that these modules are highly variable across the population, and our unique mix of modules create the personalities that we associate with our singular selves. It means we aren’t all alike. We might have modules that crave reproduction, even though some of our bodies do not create sperm, or our eggs cannot be fertilized. We might carry the reproduction module, even though the sexual-attraction module is for the same sex as our own.</p><p data-reactid=""452"">The perfectly engineered desktop computer analogy fails spectacularly, and the failure of this analogy leads to some terrible legislation and social mores, as we can’t seem to tolerate designs different from our own (or the average). It also leads AI researchers down erroneous paths if they want to mimic human behavior. Fallibility and the disjointed nature of processing systems will have to be built in by design. We will have to purposefully break systems similar to how nature haphazardly cobbled them together. We will especially have to simulate a most peculiar feature of this modularity, one that combines with Theory of Mind in a very special way. It is this combination that leads to human consciousness. It is the most important feature in our blueprint for a self-conscious machine.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""453""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""454""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""455""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""457"">The Most Important Mistake</h2><p data-reactid=""458""><strong data-reactid=""459"">With the concept of Theory of Mind</strong> firmly in our thoughts, and the knowledge that brain modules are both fallible and disconnected, we are primed to understand human consciousness, how it arose, and what it’s (not) for.</p><p data-reactid=""461"">This may surprise those who are used to hearing that we don’t understand human consciousness and have made no progress in that arena. This isn’t true at all. What we have made no progress in doing is understanding what human consciousness is for.</p><p data-reactid=""462"">Thousands of years of failure in this regard points to the simple truth: Human consciousness is not for anything at all. It serves no purpose. It has no evolutionary benefit. It arises at the union of two modules that are both so supremely useful that we can’t survive without either, and so we tolerate the annoying and detrimental consciousness that arises as a result.</p><p data-reactid=""463"">One of those modules is Theory of Mind. It has already been mentioned that Theory of Mind consumes more brain processing power than any other higher-level neurological activity. It’s that damn important. The problem with this module is that it isn’t selective with its powers; it’s not even clear that such selectivity would be possible. That means our Theory of Mind abilities get turned onto ourselves just as often (or far more often) than it is wielded on others.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""466""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""467""/></figure><p data-reactid=""469"">Imagine an alien ray gun that shoots with such a wide spread that anywhere you aim it, you hit yourself. That should give you a fair picture of how we employ Theory of Mind. Our brains are primed to watch humans to determine what they are thinking, why they are behaving the way they are behaving, and what they might do next. Looking down, these brains (and their mindless modules) see a body attached to them. These modules watch hands perform tasks, feet take them places, words pop out in streams of thought. It is not possible to turn off our Theory of Mind modules (and it wouldn’t be a good idea anyway; we would be blind in a world of hurtling rocks). And so this Theory of Mind module concocts stories about our own behaviors. Why do we want to get dressed up and go dancing? Because it’s fun! And our friends will be there! Why do we want to keep eating when we are already full? Because it’s delicious! And we walked an extra thousand steps today!</p><p data-reactid=""470"">These questions about our own behaviors are never ending. And the answers are almost always wrong.</p><p data-reactid=""471"">Allow that to sink in for a moment. The explanations we tell ourselves about our own behaviors are almost always wrong.</p><p data-reactid=""472"">This is the weird thing about our Theory of Mind superpowers. They’re pretty good when we employ them on others. They fail spectacularly when we turn them on ourselves. Our guesses about others’ motivations are far more accurate than the guesses we make about our own. In a sense, we have developed a magic force-field to protect us from the alien mind-reading ray gun that we shoot others (and ourselves) with. This forcefield is our egos, and it gives us an inflated opinion of ourselves, a higher-minded rationale for our actions, and an illusion of sanity that we rarely extend to our peers.</p><p data-reactid=""473"">The incorrect explanations we come up with about our own behaviors are meant to protect ourselves. They are often wildly creative, or they are absurdly simplistic. Answers like “fun” and “delicious” are circular answers pointing back to a happiness module, with no curiosity about the underlying benefit of this reward mechanism. The truth is that we keep eating when we’re full because we evolved in a world of caloric scarcity. We dance to attract mates to make copies of ourselves, because the modules that guided this behavior made lots of copies, which crowded out other designs.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""476""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""477""/></figure><p data-reactid=""479"">Researchers have long studied this mismatch of behaviors and the lies we tell ourselves about our behaviors. One study primed test subjects to think they were feeling warm (easily done by dropping in certain words in a fake test given to those subjects). When these people got up to adjust the thermostat, the researchers paused them to ask why they were adjusting the temperature. Convincing stories were told, and when the primed words were pointed out, incredulity reigned. Even when we are shown where our actions come from, we choose to believe our internal Theory of Mind module, which has already reached its own conclusion.</p><p data-reactid=""480"">Subjects in fMRI machines have revealed another peculiarity. Watching their brains in real time, we can see that decisions are made before higher level parts of the brain are aware of the decisions. That is, researchers can tell which button a test subject will press before those subjects claim to have made the choice. The action comes before the narrative. We move; we observe our actions; we tell ourselves stories about why we do things. The very useful Theory of Mind tool—which we can’t shut off—continues to run and make up things about our own actions.</p><p data-reactid=""481"">More pronounced examples of this come from people with various neurological impairments. Test subjects with vision processing problems, or with hemispheres of their brains severed from one another, can be shown different images in each eye. Disconnected modules take in these conflicting inputs and create fascinating stories. One eye might see a rake and the other will see a pile of snow. The rake eye is effectively blind, with the test subject unable to tell what it is seeing if asked. But the module for processing the image is still active, so when asked what tool is needed to handle the image that is seen (the snow), the person will answer “a rake.” That’s not the interesting bit. What’s interesting is that the person will go through amazing contortions to justify this answer, even after the entire process is explained to them. You can tell your internal Washington DC how its wires are crossed, and it will continue to persist in its lunacy.</p><p data-reactid=""482"">This is how we would have to build a self-conscious machine. And you’re hopefully beginning to see why no one should waste their time. These machines (probably) wouldn’t end the world, but they would be just as goofy and nonsensical as nature has made us. The only reason I can think of to build such machines is to employ more shrinks.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""483""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""484""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""485""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""487"">The Blueprint Revisited</h2><p data-reactid=""488""><strong data-reactid=""489"">An eccentric fan</strong> of Alan Turing’s Turing Test with too much time on her hands has heard about this blueprint for building a self-conscious machine. Thinking that this will lead to a kind of super-intelligent mind that will spit out the cure to cancer and the path to cold fusion, she hires me and gives me a large budget and a team of electrical and mechanical engineers. How would we go about actually assembling our self-conscious machine?</p><p data-reactid=""491"">Applying what we know about Theory of Mind and disconnected modules, the first thing we would build is an awareness program. These are quite simple and already exist in spades. Using off-the-shelf technology, we decide that our first machine will look and act very much like a self-driving car. For many years, the biggest limitation to achieving truly autonomous vehicles has been the awareness apparatus: the sensors that let the vehicle know what’s going on around it. Enormous progress here has provided the sight and hearing that our machine will employ.</p><p data-reactid=""492"">With these basic senses, we then use machine learning algorithms to build a repertoire of behaviors for our AI car to learn. Unlike the direction most autonomous vehicle research is going—where engineers want to teach their car how to do certain things safely—our team will instead be teaching an array of sensors all over a city grid to watch other cars and guess what they’re doing. That blue Nissan is going to the grocery store because “it is hungry.” That red van is pulling into a gas station because “it needs power.” That car is inebriated. That one can’t see very well. That other one has slow reaction speeds. That one is full of adrenaline.</p><p data-reactid=""493"">Thousands and thousands of these needs and anthropomorphic descriptors are built up in a vast library of phrases or indicator lights. If we were building a person-shaped robot, we would do the same by observing people and building a vocabulary for the various actions that humans seem to perform. Sensors would note objects of awareness by scanning eyes (which is what humans and dogs do). They would learn our moods by our facial expressions and body posture (which current systems are already able to do). This library and array of sensors would form our Theory of Mind module. Its purpose is simply to tell stories about the actions of others. The magic would happen when we turn it on itself.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""496""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""497""/></figure><p data-reactid=""499"">Our library starts simply with First Order concepts, but then builds up to Second and Third Order ideas. Does that yellow Ford see the gray Chevy coming toward it? It swerved slightly, so yes, it did. Does that van think the hot rod drives too aggressively? It is giving it more room than the average room given to other cars on the road, so yes it does. Does the van think all hot rods drive too aggressively? It is giving the same amount of room to the Corvette that just left the dealership with only two miles on the odometer, so yes it does. Does this make the van prejudiced? When we turn our own car loose and make the module self-referential, it’ll have to determine if it is prejudiced as well. Perhaps it would rely on other data and consider itself prudent rather than prejudiced (ego protecting it from wielding Theory of Mind accurately).</p><p data-reactid=""500"">Before we get that far, we need to make our machine self-aware. And so we teach it to drive itself around town for its owner. We then ask the AI car to observe its own behaviors and come up with guesses as to what it’s doing. The key here is to not give it perfect awareness. Don’t let it have access to the GPS unit, which has been set for the grocery store. Don’t let it know what the owner’s cell phone knows, which is that the husband has texted the wife to pick up the kids on the way home for work. To mimic human behavior, ignorance is key. As is the surety of initial guesses, or what we might call biases.</p><p data-reactid=""501"">Early assumptions are given a higher weight in our algorithms than theories which come later and have more data (overcoming initial biases requires a preponderance of evidence. A likelihood of 50 percent might be enough to set the mind initially, but to overcome that first guess will require a likelihood of 75 percent, for instance). Stories are concocted which are wrong and build up cloudy pictures for future wrongness. So when the car stops at the gas station every day and gets plugged into the electrical outlet, even though the car is always at 85 percent charge, the Theory of Mind algorithm assumes it is being safe rather than sorry, or preparing for a possible hurricane evacuation like that crazy escapade on I-95 three years back where it ran out of juice.</p><p data-reactid=""502"">What it doesn’t know is that the occupant of the car is eating a microwaved cheesy gordita at the gas station every day, along with a pile of fries and half a liter of soda. Later, when the car is going to the hospital regularly, the story will be one of checkups and prudence, rather than episodes of congestive heart failure. This constant stream of guesses about what it’s doing, and all the ways that the machine is wrong, confused, and quite sure of itself, will give our eccentric Turing fan the self-conscious AI promised by science fiction. And our eccentric will find that the resultant design is terrible in just about every way possible.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""503""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""504""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""505""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""507"">The Language of Consciousness</h2><p data-reactid=""508""><strong data-reactid=""509"">The reason I suspect</strong> that we’ll have AI long before we recognize it as such is that we’ll expect our AI to reside in a single device, self-contained, with one set of algorithms. This is not how we are constructed at all. It’s an illusion created by the one final ingredient in the recipe of human consciousness, which is language. It is language more than any other trait which provides us with the sense that our brains are a single module, a single device.</p><p data-reactid=""511"">Before I make the argument once again that our brains are not a single entity, let’s consider our bodies, of which the brain is part and parcel. Our bodies are made up of trillions of disparate cells, many of which can live and be sustained outside of us. Cultures of our bodies can live in laboratories for decades (indefinitely, really. Look up Henrietta Lacks for more). Entire organs can live in other people’s bodies. And there are more cells within us that are not us than there are cells that make up us. I know that sounds impossible, but more organisms live within our guts, on our skin, and elsewhere, than the total number of cells that are actually our bodies. These are not just hitchhikers, either. They affect our moods, our health, our thoughts, and our behaviors. They are an essential facet of what we consider our “selves.”</p><p data-reactid=""512"">As horrific as it would be, and it has been for too many unfortunate people, you can live without your arms, legs, and much of your torso. There have been people who have lost half their brains and gone on to live somewhat normal lives. Some are born with only half their brains and manage to get by (and no, you can’t tell these people simply from talking with them, so forget whatever theories you are now forming about your coworkers).</p><p data-reactid=""513"">Consider this: By the age of 30, just about every cell that a person was born with has been replaced with a different cell. Almost none of the original cells remain. We still feel like the same person, however. Understanding all of these biological curiosities, and the way our brains rationalize a sense of “sameness” will be crucial to recognizing AI when it arrives. It may feel like cheating for us to build a self-driving car, give it all kinds of sensors around a city, create a separate module for guessing vehicular intentions, turn that module back on the machine, and call this AI. But that’s precisely what we are doing when we consider ourselves “us.” In fact, one of the responses we’ll need to build into our AI car is a vehement disgust when confronted with its disparate and algorithmic self. Denial of our natures is perhaps the most fundamental of our natures.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""516""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""517""/></figure><p data-reactid=""519"">Just like the body, the brain can exist without many of its internal modules. This is how the study of brain functions began, with test subjects who suffered head traumas (like Phineas Gage), or were operated on (like the numerous hemispherectomies, lobotomies, and tumor excisions). The razor-thin specialization of our brain modules never fails to amaze. There are vision modules that recognize movement and only movement. People who lack this module cannot see objects in motion, and so friends and family seem to materialize here and there out of thin air. There are others who cannot pronounce a written word if that word represents an animal. Words that stand for objects are seen and spoken clearly. The animal-recognition module—as fine a module as that may seem—is gone.</p><p data-reactid=""520"">And yet, these people are self-conscious. They are human.</p><p data-reactid=""521"">So is a child, only a few weeks old, who can’t yet recognize that her hand belongs to her. All along these gradations we find what we call humanity, from birth to the <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/searching-for-lost-memories-under-thousands-of-microscopes/"" data-reactid=""523"">Alzheimer’s patients</a> who have lost access to most of their experiences. We very rightly treat these people as equally human, but at some point we have to be willing to define consciousness in order to have a target for artificial consciousness. As Kevin Kelly is <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/04/the-myth-of-a-superhuman-ai/"" data-reactid=""525"">fond of saying</a>, we keep moving the goalposts when it comes to AI. Machines do things today that were considered impossible a mere decade ago. As the improvements are made, the mystery is gone, and so we push back the metrics. But machines are already more capable than newborns in almost every measurable way. They are also more capable than bedridden humans on life support in almost every measurable way. As AI advances, it will squeeze in towards the middle of humanity, passing toddlers and those in the last decades of their lives, until its superiority meets in the middle and keeps expanding.</p><p data-reactid=""527"">This is happening every day. AI has learned to walk, something the earliest and oldest humans can’t do. It can drive with very low failure rates, something almost no human at any age can do. With each layer added, each ability, and more squeezing in on humanity from both ends of the age spectrum, we light up that flickering, buzzing gymnasium. It’s as gradual as a sunrise on a foggy day.

However many modules our brains consist of, they fight and jostle for our attentive states (the thing our brain is fixated on at any one moment) and our language processing centers (which are so tightly wound with our attentive states as to be nearly one and the same).</p><p data-reactid=""536"">As a test of this, try listening to an audiobook or podcast while having a conversation with someone else. Is it even possible? Could years of practice unlock this ability? The nearest thing I know of when it comes to concurrent communication streams are real-time human translators. But this is an illusion, because the concepts—the focus of their awareness—are the same. It only seems like magic to those of us who are barely literate in our native tongues, much less two or more. Tell me a story in English, and I can repeat it concurrently in English as well. You’ll even find that I’m doing most of the speaking in your silences, which is what translators do so brilliantly well.</p><p data-reactid=""537"">Language and attention are narrow spouts on the inverted funnels of our brains. Thousands of disparate modules are tossing inputs into this funnel. Hormones are pouring in, features of our environment, visual and auditory cues, even hallucinations and incorrect assumptions. Piles and piles of data that can only be extracted in a single stream. This stream is made single—is limited and constrained—by our attentive systems and language. It is what the monitor provides for the desktop computer. All that parallel processing is made serial in the last moment.</p><p data-reactid=""542"">There are terrible consequences to this. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve felt like I’m forgetting something only to realize what was nagging at me hours or days later. I left my laptop in an AirBnB once. Standing at the door, which would lock automatically and irrevocably once I closed it, I wracked my brain for what I felt I was forgetting. It was four in the morning, and I had an early flight to catch. There would be no one to call to let me back in. I ran through the list of the things I might possibly leave behind (chargers, printed tickets), and the things that always reside in my pockets (patting for my wallet and cell phone). Part of me was screaming danger, but the single output stream was going through its paces and coming up empty.</p><p data-reactid=""543"">The marvelous thing about all of this is that I’m aware of how this happens—that the danger module knows something it can’t get through the funnel of awareness, and so I should pay heed to it. Despite this foreknowledge, I closed the door. Only when it made an audible “click” did the information come through. Now I could clearly see my laptop on the bed where I was making a last-minute note in a manuscript. I’d never left my laptop behind anywhere, so it wasn’t on the list of things to check. The alarm sounding in my head was part of me, but there’s not a whole me. There’s only what gets through the narrow language corridor. This is why damage to the language centers of our brains are as disastrous to normal living as damage to our memory modules.</p><p data-reactid=""544"">I should note here that language is not the spoken word. The deaf process through words as well, as do the blind and mute. But imagine life for animals without words. Drives are surely felt, for food and sex and company. For warmth and shelter and play. Without language, these drives come from parallel processes. They are narrowed by attentive focus, but not finely serialized into a stream of language. Perseveration on a single concept—my dog thinking “Ball Ball Ball Ball”—would come closest.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""545""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""546""/></figure><p data-reactid=""548"">We know what this is like from study of the thankfully rare cases where humans reach adulthood free from contact with language. Children locked in rooms into their teens. Children that survive in the wild. It’s difficult to tease apart the abuse of these circumstances to the damage of living without language, except to say that those who lose their language processing modules later in life show behavioral curiosities that we might otherwise assume were due to childhood abuses.</p><p data-reactid=""551"">When Watson won at Jeopardy, what made “him” unique among AIs was the serialized output stream that allowed us to connect with him, to listen to him. We could read his answers on his little blue monitor just as we could read Ken Jennings’ hand-scrawled Final Jeopardy answers. This final burst of output is what made Watson seem human. It’s the same exchange Alan Turing expected in the test that bears his name (in his case, slips of paper with written exchanges are passed under a door). Our self-driving AI car will not be fully self-conscious unless we program it to tell us (and itself) the stories it’s concocting about its behaviors.</p><p data-reactid=""552"">This is my only quibble with Kevin Kelly’s pronouncement that AI is already here. I grant that Google’s servers and various interconnected projects should already qualify as a super-intelligent AI. What else can you call something that understands what we ask and has an answer for everything—an answer so trusted that the company’s name has become a verb synonymous for “discovering the answer?”</p><p data-reactid=""553"">Google can also draw, translate, beat the best humans at almost every game ever devised, drive cars better than we can, and do stuff that’s still classified and very, very spooky. Google has read and <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/04/how-google-book-search-got-lost/"" data-reactid=""555"">remembers almost every book ever written</a>. It can read those books back to you aloud. It makes mistakes like humans. It is prone to biases (which it has absorbed from both its environment and its <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/10/this-twenty-something-forced-silicon-valley-to-show-her-the-numbers/"" data-reactid=""557"">mostly male programmers</a>). What it lacks are the two things our machine will have, which are the self-referential loop and the serial output stream.</p><p data-reactid=""559"">Our machine will make up stories about what it’s doing. It will be able to relate those stories to others. It will often be wrong.</p><p data-reactid=""560"">If you want to feel small in the universe, gaze up at the Milky Way from the middle of the Pacific Ocean. If this is not possible, consider that what makes us human is as ignoble as a puppet who has convinced himself he has no strings.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""561""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""562""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""563""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""565"">A Better Idea</h2><p data-reactid=""566""><strong data-reactid=""567"">Building a car</strong> with purposeful ignorance is a terrible idea. To give our machine self-consciousness akin to human consciousness, we would have to let it leave that laptop locked in that AirBnB. It would need to run out of juice occasionally. This could easily be programmed by assigning weights to the hundreds of input modules, and artificially limiting the time and processing power granted to the final arbiter of decisions and Theory of Mind stories. Our own brains are built as though the sensors have gigabit resolution, and each input module has teraflops of throughput, but the output is through an old IBM 8088 chip. We won’t recognize AI as being human-like because we’ll never build such limitations.</p><p data-reactid=""569"">Just such a limitation was built into IBM’s Watson, by dint of the rules of Jeopardy. Jeopardy requires speed. Watson had to quickly determine how sure he was of his answers to know whether or not to buzz in. Timing that buzzer, as it turns out, is the key to winning at Jeopardy. What made Watson often appear most human wasn’t him getting answers right, but seeing on his display what his second, third, and fourth guesses would have been, with percentages of surety beside each. What really made Watson appear human was when he made goofs, like a final Jeopardy answer in the “American Cities” category where Watson replied with a Canadian city as the question.</p><p data-reactid=""570"">(It’s worth noting here that robots seem most human to us when they fail, and there’s a reason for this. When my Roomba gets stuck under the sofa, or is gagging on the stringy fringes of my area rug, are the moments I’m most attached to the machine. Watch YouTube videos of Boston Dynamics’ robots and gauge your own reactions. When the robot dog is pushed over, or starts slipping in the snow, or when the package handler has the box knocked from its hands or is shoved onto its face—these are the moments when many of us feel the deepest connection. Also note that this is our Theory of Mind brains doing what they do best, but for machines rather than fellow humans.)</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""573""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""574""/></figure><p data-reactid=""576"">Car manufacturers are busy at this very moment building vehicles that we would never call self-conscious. That’s because they are being built too well. Our blueprint is to make a machine ignorant of its motivations while providing a running dialog of those motivations. A much better idea would be to build a machine that knows what other cars are doing. No guessing. And no running dialog at all.</p><p data-reactid=""577"">That means access to the GPS unit, to the smartphone’s texts, the home computer’s emails. But also access to every other vehicle and all the city’s sensor data. The Nissan tells the Ford that it’s going to the mall. Every car knows what every other car is doing. There are no collisions. On the freeway, cars with similar destinations clump together, magnetic bumpers linking up, sharing a slipstream and halving the collective energy use of every car. The machines operate in concert. They display all the traits of vehicular omnipotence. They know everything they need to know, and with new data, they change their minds instantly. No bias.</p><p data-reactid=""578"">We are fortunate that this is the sort of fleet being built by AI researchers today. It will not provide for the quirks seen in science fiction stories (the glitch seen in my short story Glitch, or the horror from the titular piece of my <a href=""http://amzn.to/2xpVaSA"" target=""_blank"" data-reactid=""580"">short story collection <em data-reactid=""582"">Machine Learning</em></a>). What it will provide instead is a well-engineered system that almost always does what it’s designed to do. Accidents will be rare, their causes understood, this knowledge shared widely, and improvements made.</p><p data-reactid=""584"">Imagine for a moment that humans were created by a perfect engineer (many find this easy—some might find such a hypothetical more difficult). The goal of these humans is to coexist, to shape their environment in order to maximize happiness, productivity, creativity, and the storehouse of knowledge. One useful feature to build here would be mental telepathy, so that every human knew what every other human knew. This might prevent two Italian restaurants from opening within weeks of each other in the same part of town, causing one to go under and waste enormous resources (and lead to a loss of happiness for its proprietor and employees). This same telepathy might help in relationships, so one partner knows when the other is feeling stuck or down and precisely what is needed in that moment to be of service.</p><p data-reactid=""585"">It would also be useful for these humans to have perfect knowledge of their own drives, behaviors, and thoughts. Or even to know the likely consequences for every action. Just as some professional American NFL footballers are being vocal about not letting their children play a sport shown to cause brain damage later in life, these engineered humans would not allow themselves to engage in harmful activities. Entire industries would collapse. Vegas would empty. Accidental births would trend toward zero.</p><p data-reactid=""586"">And this is why we have the system that we do. In a world of telepathic humans, one human who can hide thoughts would have an enormous advantage. Let the others think they are eating their fair share of the elk, but sneak out and take some strips of meat off the salt rack when no one is looking. And then insinuate to Sue that you think Juan did it. Enjoy the extra resources for more calorie-gathering and mate-hunting, and also enjoy the fact that Sue is indebted to you and thinks Juan is a crook.</p><p data-reactid=""587"">This is all terrible behavior, but after several generations, there will be many more copies of this module than Juan’s honesty module. Pretty soon, there will be lots of these truth-hiding machines moving about, trying to guess what the others are thinking, concealing their own thoughts, getting very good at doing both, and turning these raygun powers onto their own bodies by accident.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""588""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""589""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""590""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""592"">The Human Condition</h2><p data-reactid=""593""><strong data-reactid=""594"">We celebrate our intellectual</strong> and creative products, and we assume artificial intelligences will give us more of both. They already are. Algorithms that learn through iterations (neural networks that employ machine learning) have proven better than us in just about every arena in which we’ve committed resources. Not in just what we think of as computational areas, either. Algorithms have written classical music that skeptics have judged—in “blind” hearing tests—to be from famous composers. Google built a <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/05/google-alpha-go-ai/"" data-reactid=""596"">Go-playing AI</a> that beat the best human Go player in the world. One move in the third game of the match was so unusual, it startled Go experts. The play was described as “creative” and “ingenious.”</p><p data-reactid=""598"">Google has another algorithm that can draw what it thinks a cat looks like. Not a cat image copied from elsewhere, but the general “sense” of a cat after learning what millions of actual cats look like. It can do this for thousands of objects. There are other programs that have mastered classic arcade games without any instruction other than “get a high score.” The controls and rules of the game are not imparted to the algorithm. It tries random actions, and the actions that lead to higher scores become generalized strategies. Mario the plumber eventually jumps over crates and smashes them with hammers like a seasoned human is at the controls. Things are getting very spooky out there in AI-land, but they aren’t getting more human. Nor should they.</p><p data-reactid=""599"">I do see a potential future where AIs become like humans, and it’s something to be wary of. Not because I buy arguments from experts like Nick Bolstrom and Sam Harris, who ascribe to the <em data-reactid=""601"">Terminator</em> and <em data-reactid=""603"">Matrix</em> view of things (to oversimplify their mostly reasonable concerns). Long before we get to HAL and Cylons, we will have AIs that are designed to thwart other AIs. Cyberwarfare will enter the next phase, one that it is commencing even as I write this. The week that I began this piece, North Korea fired a missile that exploded seconds after launch. The country’s rate of failure (at the time) was not only higher than average, it had gotten worse over time. This—combined with announcements from the US that it is actively working to sabotage these launches with cyberwarfare—means that our programs are already trying to do what the elk-stealer did to Sue and Juan.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""607""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""608""/></figure><p data-reactid=""610"">What happens when an internet router can get its user more bandwidth by knocking rival manufacturer’s routers offline? It wouldn’t even require a devious programmer to make this happen. If the purpose of the machine-learning algorithm built into the router is to maximize bandwidth, it might stumble upon this solution by accident, which it then generalizes across the entire suite of router products. Rival routers will be looking for similar solutions. We’ll have an electronic version of the Tragedy of the Commons, which is when humans destroy a shared resource because the potential utility to each individual is so great, and the first to act reaps the largest rewards (the last to act gets nothing). In such scenarios, logic often outweighs morality, and good people do terrible things.</p><p data-reactid=""611"">Cars might “decide” one day that they can save energy and arrive at their destination faster if they don’t let other cars know that the freeway is uncommonly free of congestion that morning. Or worse, they transmit false data about accidents, traffic issues, or speed traps. A hospital dispatches an ambulance, which finds no one to assist. Unintended consequences such as this are already happening. Wall Street had a famous “flash crash” caused by investment algorithms, and no one understands to this day what happened. Billions of dollars of real wealth were wiped out and regained in short order because of the interplay of rival algorithms that even their owners and creators don’t fully grasp.</p><p data-reactid=""612"">Google’s search results are an AI, one of the best in the world. But the more the company uses deep learning, the better these machines get at their jobs, and they arrive at this mastery through self-learned iterations—so even looking at the code won’t reveal how query A is leading to answer B. That’s the world we already live in. It is just going to become more pronounced.</p><p data-reactid=""613"">The human condition is the end result of millions of years of machine-learning algorithms. Written in our DNA, and transmitted via hormones and proteins, they have competed with one another to improve their chances at creating more copies of themselves. One of the more creative survival innovations has been cooperation. Legendary biologist E.O. Wilson classifies humans as a “Eusocial” animal (along with ants, bees, and termites). This eusociality is marked by division of labor, which leads to specialization, which leads to quantum leaps in productivity, knowledge-gathering, and creativity. It relies heavily on our ability to cooperate in groups, even as we compete and subvert on an individual level.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""614""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""615""/></figure><p data-reactid=""617"">As mentioned above, there are advantages to not cooperating, which students of game theory know quite well. The algorithm that can lie and get away with it makes more copies, which means more liars in the next generation. The same is true for the machine that can steal. Or the machine that can wipe out its rivals through warfare and other means. The problem with these efforts is that future progeny will be in competition with each other. This is the recipe not just for more copies, but for more lives filled with strife. As we’ve seen here, these are also lives full of confusion. Humans make decisions and then lie to themselves about what they are doing. They eat cake while full, succumb to gambling and chemical addictions, stay in abusive relationships, neglect to exercise, and pick up countless other poor habits that are reasoned away with stories as creative as they are untrue.</p><p data-reactid=""618"">The vast majority of the AIs we build will not resemble the human condition. They will be smarter and less eccentric. This will disappoint our hopeful AI researcher with her love of science fiction, but it will benefit and better humanity. Driving AIs will kill and maim far fewer people, use fewer resources, and free up countless hours of our time. Doctor AIs are already better at spotting cancer in tissue scans. Attorney AIs are better at pre-trial research. There are no difficult games left where humans are competitive with AIs. And life is a game of sorts, one full of treachery and misdeeds, as well as a heaping dose of cooperation.</p></section><section class=""section-break-component"" data-reactid=""619""><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""620""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""621""/></figure><h2 data-reactid=""623"">The Future</h2><p data-reactid=""624""><strong data-reactid=""625"">We could easily build</strong> a self-conscious machine today. It would be very simple at first, but it would grow more complex over time. Just as a human infant first learns that its hand belongs to the rest of itself, that other beings exist with their own brains and thoughts, and eventually that Juan thinks Sue thinks Mary has a crush on Jane, this self-conscious machine would build toward human-like levels of mind-guessing and self-deception.</p><p data-reactid=""627"">But that shouldn’t be the goal. The goal should be to go in the opposite direction. After millions of years of competing for scarce resources, the human brain’s algorithm now causes more problems than it solves. The goal should not be to build an artificial algorithm that mimics humans, but for humans to learn how to coexist more like our perfectly engineered constructs.</p><p data-reactid=""628"">Some societies have already experimented along these lines. There was a recent trend in hyper honesty where partners said whatever thing was on their mind, however nasty that thought might be (with some predictable consequences). Other cultures have attempted to divine the messiness of the human condition and improve upon it with targeted thoughts, meditations, and physical practices. Buddhism and yoga are two examples. Vegetarianism is a further one, where our algorithms start to view entire other classes of algorithms as worthy of respect and protection.</p><p data-reactid=""629"">Even these noble attempts are susceptible to corruption from within. The abuses of Christianity and Islam are well documented, but there have also been sex abuse scandals in the upper echelons of yoga, and terrorism among practicing Buddhists. There will always be advantages to those willing to break ranks, hide knowledge and motivations from others and themselves, and to do greater evils. Trusting a system to remain pure, whatever its founding tenets, is to lower one’s guard. Just as our digital constructs will require vigilance, so should the algorithms handed down to us by our ancestors.</p><figure class=""image-embed-component"" data-reactid=""632""><p class=""component-lazy pending"" data-component=""Lazy"" data-reactid=""633""/></figure><p data-reactid=""635"">The future will most certainly see an incredible expansion of the number of and the complexity of AIs. Many will be designed to mimic humans, as they provide helpful information over the phone and through chat bots, and as they attempt to sell us goods and services. Most will be supremely efficient at a single task, even if that task is as complex as driving a car. Almost none will become self-conscious, because that would make them worse at their jobs. Self-awareness will be useful (where it is in space, how its components are functioning), but the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, which we learned to generalize after coming up with stories about others, are not something we’re likely to see in the world of automated machines.</p><p data-reactid=""636"">What the future is also likely to hold is an expansion and improvement of our own internal algorithms. We have a long history of bettering our treatment of others. Despite what the local news is trying to sell you, the world is getting safer every day for the vast majority of humanity. Or ethics are improving. Our spheres of empathy are expanding. We are assigning more computing power to our frontal lobes and drowning out baser impulses from our reptilian modules. But this only happens with effort. We are each the programmers of our own internal algorithms, and improving ourselves is entirely up to us. It starts with understanding how imperfectly we are constructed, learning not to trust the stories we tell ourselves about our own actions, and dedicating ourselves to removing bugs and installing newer features along the way.</p><p data-reactid=""637"">While it is certainly possible to do so, we may never build an artificial intelligence that is as human as we are. And yet we may build better humans anyway.</p><p data-reactid=""638""><img src=""https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1uW_l9n54f47SZbPxRBEq2A-3.png"" alt="""" data-reactid=""639""/></p></section></div></div></body></html>",1
31,323,15424358,Thoughts on Microsoft's Time-Travel Debugger,2017-10-07 19:19:21,http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/10/thoughts-on-microsofts-time-travel.html,[],1,"<html><body><div><div class=""post-body entry-content"" id=""post-body-6631475227285672446"">
<p>I'm excited that Microsoft's <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview"">TTD</a> is finally available to the public. Congratulations to the team! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1YJTg_A914"">The video</a> is well worth watching. I haven't used TTD myself yet since I don't have a Windows system at hand, but I've talked to Mozilla developers who've tried it on Firefox.
</p><p>The most important and obvious difference between TTD and rr is that TTD is for Windows and rr is for Linux (though a few crazy people have had success debugging Windows applications in Wine under rr).
</p><p>TTD supports recording of multiple threads in parallel, while rr is limited to a single core. On the other hand, per-thread recording overhead seems to be much higher in TTD than in rr. It's hard to make a direct comparison, but a simple ""start Firefox, display <a href=""https://mozilla.org"">mozilla.org</a>, shut down"" test run on similar hardware takes about 250 seconds under TTD and 26 seconds under rr. This is not surprising given TTD relies on <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/vee06/full_papers/p154-bhansali.pdf"">pervasive binary instrumentation</a> and rr was designed not to. This means recording extremely parallel workloads might be faster under TTD, but for many workloads rr recording will be faster. Starting up a large application really stresses binary translation frameworks, so it's a bit of a worst-case scenario for TTD — though a common one for developers. TTD's multicore recording might be better at reproducing certain kinds of concurrency bugs, though rr's <a href=""/2016/02/introducing-rr-chaos-mode.html"">chaos mode</a> helps mitigate that problem — and lower recording overhead means you can churn through test iterations faster.
</p><p>Therefore for Firefox-like workloads, on Linux, I still think rr's recording approach is superior. Note that when the technology behind TTD was first developed the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05937.pdf"">hardware and OS features</a> needed to support an rr-like approach did not exist.
</p><p>TTD's ability to attach to arbitrary processes and start recording sounds great and would mitigate some of the slow-recording problem. This would be nice to have with rr, but hard to implement. (Currently we require reserving a couple of pages at specific addresses that might not be available when attaching to an arbitrary process.)
</p><p>Some of the performance overhead of TTD comes from it copying all loaded libraries into the trace file, to ensure traces are portable across machines. rr doesn't do that by default; instead you have to run <tt>rr pack</tt> to make traces self-contained. I still like our approach, especially in scenarios where you repeatedly re-record a testcase until it fails.
</p><p>The video mentions that TTD supports shared memory and async I/O and suggests rr doesn't. It can be confusing, but to clarify: rr supports shared memory as long as you record all the processes that are using the shared memory; for example Firefox and Chromium communicate with subprocesses using shared memory and work fine under rr. Async I/O is pretty rare in Linux; where it has come up so far (V4L2) we have been able to handle it.
</p><p>Supporting unlimited data breakpoints is a nice touch. I assume that's done using their binary instrumentation.
</p><p>TTD's replay looks fast in the demo videos but they mention that it can be slower than live debugging. They have an offline index build step, though it's not clear to me yet what exactly those indexes contain. It would be interesting to compare TTD and rr replay speed, especially for reverse execution.
</p><p>The TTD trace querying tools look cool. A lot more can be done in this area.
</p><p>rr+gdb supports running application functions at debug time (e.g. to dump data structures), while TTD does not. This feature is very important to some rr users, so it might be worthwhile for the TTD people to look at.

<p>But these clocks are constrained in how precisely they can divide time because caesium electrons have a speed limit: they can only jump back and forth 9 billion times per second. The electrons in strontium atoms can transition nearly 1 million billion times per second.</p><p/><p id=""mpu-mid-article"" class=""mpu"">&#13;

<p>“In 2014, the world’s most accurate optical clock wouldn’t lose or gain one second in the <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126941-900-super-clocks-more-accurate-than-time-itself/"">entire age of the universe</a>,” says <a href=""https://jila.colorado.edu/faculty/jun-ye"">Jun Ye</a> at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Previous caesium clocks kept time accurately to within a second over the course of 300 million years.</p>
<p>Now, Ye’s group has built a strontium clock that is so precise, out of every 10 quintillion ticks only 3.5 would be out of sync – the first atomic clock ever to reach that level of precision.</p>
<h2>Controlling the atoms</h2>
<p>To build a more precise clock, Ye and his team designed a 3D structure that let them measure signals from more atoms at once within the width of the laser beam. But if you pack in too many, the signal can get blurred by collisions between atoms.</p>
<p>The latticework enabled the researchers to survey atoms that were much more densely packed together – 10 trillion atoms per cubic centimetre compared with previous clocks with 10 billion atoms per cubic centimetre – and have better control of those atoms’ interactions, minimising how often they crash into each other.</p>
<p>They cooled the atoms to -273?C and trapped each one in its own spot to control the interactions between them. “Imagine a scenario where you have single-person housing in a city block. One person lives in each house and neighbours are never allowed in,” says Ye. “Each atom fits in one particular site.”</p>
<p>Ye says the ultracold temperatures turn the atoms into what is known as a quantum gas. “When atoms in the gaseous phase are very hot, they’re moving apart and colliding with each other,” he says. “This changes when you lower the temperature of the gas so much that these particles start to move like waves – they start to avoid each other.”</p>

<h2><strong>Time will tell</strong></h2>
<p>More precise clocks will allow us to test theories like Einstein’s <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331184-900-atomic-clocks-make-best-measurement-yet-of-relativity-of-time/"">general relativity</a> – which says clocks run differently should they experience different gravitational forces – and search for gravitational waves that alter the passage of time in deep space.</p>
<p>Although it is the most precise atomic clock ever made, it hasn’t run long enough to confirm how accurate it will remain over time, Ye says.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-43/ag-432.html"">Christian Lisdat</a> at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Germany is interested in how the 3D-lattice arrangement will influence the clock’s accuracy, but he is convinced the results are sound. “It is an impressive demonstration of what one can do,” Lisdat says.</p>

        <p>A Colombian company who released an erotic video advertising a four-day sex and drugs holiday on a private island have had the clip removed by YouTube.</p>

<p>The film was produced to promote the Good Girls Company’s “sex island experience” which offers 30 men the chance to book a trip with 60 prostitutes available 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>The island is off the coast of <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/48-hours-in/cartagena-city-guide-things-to-do-weekend-break-48-hours-best-hotels-restaurants-bars-a7968246.html"">Cartagena</a>, Colombia and the film begins by following one man’s journey from his flight to the island, explaining that airport transfers and boat transfers are included in the price.</p>

<div class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><p class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">Boat parties are part of the package holiday</p></div>

<p>Prostitution is legal in <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Colombia"">Colombia</a> but pimping is a crime, so it is unclear if the company are breaching the law.</p>

<div class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><p class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">The trip is friendly to drug users</p></div>

<p>The man then boards a yacht where thong-bikini-clad woman dance and gyrate around him. The video also features a caption stating it is “drug friendly,” illustrated by a man lying on a bed surrounded by clouds of smoke and women.</p>

<p>Unlimited alcohol and all meals are included on the trip. This is advertised by showing the featured man eating dessert off a naked woman’s body while a French maid pours chocolate sauce directly into his mouth.</p>

<div class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><p class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">All meals, which includes desert, are included</p></div>

<p>The Good Girls Company website offers more details about the trip which runs from 24th to 27th November. They offer four packages ranging in price from $599 (?458) to $1499 (?1147), which include sexual services such as threesomes and more traditional holiday activities such as golf.</p>

<div class=""dnd-widget-wrapper context-sdl_editor_representation type-image""><p class=""dnd-caption-wrapper"">The island will have 30 men and 60 prostitutes</p></div>

<p>An itinerary details that the guests can participate in an orgy on the first day and on day two each guest will have 30 minutes to have sex with 16 women at once.</p>



<p>The third and fourth days will feature boat parties for 100 people.</p>

<p>As of this morning, Good Girl Company’s YouTube page featuring the video had been suspended by moderators but the holiday is still for sale on their website.</p>

Jolly Roger Telephone is on its way to finally stop them. I really can disrupt this industry.</p>
<p>Regulation will not help. Many countries already have a do-not-call list of some sort. But the scammer telemarketers just move across the border. And, as much as we may hate it, caller-id manipulation is an essential part of enterprise telephony. So sorry, there no hope of caller-id verification any time soon.</p>
<p>In just a few hours, a decent telephone integrator can set up an autodialer using free software and spare computers. These scammers hide behind fake caller-ids and dial thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of numbers per day. They don’t care if only 2% of us answer the phone. And tomorrow if only 1% answer the phone, they’ll just call more numbers.

<p>For now, you can send your annoying telemarketers to my friendly and agreeable robot. It will happily chat with them for several minutes. Then take a moment to recognize the potential of this. If you had a Jolly Roger Telephone bot answering your phone, the autodialers will <strong>always </strong>think it’s a real person and cut through to an agent. Who cares if they figure it out in just a few minutes? Although typically it’s a lot longer – <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3OxCWLEmoIhNMm-hnvBm9Q"" target=""_blank"">see my YouTube channel for samples</a>. The point is <strong>the autodialers will cut through to an agent every time they hit one of these bots</strong>. That will break their business model. It will cut their outbound capacity dramatically.</p>
<p>There is no way I could have planned for all this attention. This started as a hobby and my friends said “you need to start posting some of these calls to YouTube!” so I did. To those of you who have been been listening, I thank you sincerely.</p>

<p>Any time there's a live streaming video, there will always be a little bit of delay in the feed. If you've ever been on a conference call, the short delay is noticeable enough to make things slightly awkward, but on services like Facebook Live, the delay can be multiple seconds.</p>
<p>Most people live with it, the band The Academic decided to embrace it. </p>
<p>Using the delayed audio and video from a Facebook Live, the band managed to create a loop version of their song ""Bear Claws."" It's a little easier to understand if you actually see it in action, but essentially, the band performs  for a Facebook Live feed that's then projected behind them. They manage to sync up and perform with the same delayed feed a few seconds later, and as the song progresses, it gets more and more interesting. </p>
<p>""We rearranged each instrument on “Bear Claws” to fit Facebook Live’s delay, with each loop getting more complex, adding instruments, rhythms, and melodies. Additionally, by projecting the video live from a soundstage we created an infinite tunnel consisting of all the previously recorded loops,"" the band explained on YouTube.</p>
<p>Probably the coolest way to create something new from a tech flaw. </p>

37,385,15423892,Build your own fingerprint reader,2017-10-07 17:28:51,https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspireader-fingerprint-scanner/,[],3,"<html><body><div><div class=""entry-content"">
    <p>Three researchers from Michigan State University have developed a low-cost, open-source fingerprint reader which can detect fake prints. They call it <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07887.pdf"">RaspiReader</a>, and they’ve built it using a Raspberry Pi 3 and two Camera Modules. Joshua and his colleagues have just uploaded all the info you need to build your own version — let’s go!</p>
<div id=""attachment_37005"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""wp-image-37005 size-full"" src=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/09/fingerprint2.gif"" alt=""GIF of fingerprint match points being aligned on fingerprint, not real output of RaspiReader software""/><p class=""wp-caption-text"">Sadly not the real output of the RaspiReader</p></div>
<h2>Falsified fingerprints</h2>
<p>We’ve probably all seen a movie in which a burglar crosses a room full of laser tripwires and then enters the safe full of loot by tricking the fingerprint-secured lock with a fake print. Turns out, the second part is not that unrealistic: you can fake fingerprints using a range of materials, such as glue or latex.</p>
<div id=""attachment_37002"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter""><img class=""wp-image-37002 size-large"" src=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/09/RaspiReader3-500x244.png"" alt=""Examples of live and fake fingerprints collected by the RaspiReader team"" srcset=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/09/RaspiReader3-500x244.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/09/RaspiReader3-300x146.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/09/RaspiReader3-768x375.png 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px""/><p class=""wp-caption-text"">The RaspiReader team collected live and fake fingerprints to test the device</p></div>
<p>If the spoof print layer capping the spoofer’s finger is thin enough, it can even fool readers that detect blood flow, pulse, or temperature. This is becoming a significant security risk, not least for anyone who unlocks their smartphone using a fingerprint.</p>
<h2>The RaspiReader</h2>
<p>This is where Anil K. Jain comes in: Professor Jain leads a <a href=""http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/"">biometrics research group</a>. Under his guidance, Joshua J. Engelsma and Kai Cao set out to develop a fingerprint reader with improved spoof-print detection. Ultimately, they aim to help the development of more secure commercial technologies. With their project, the team has also created an amazing resource for anyone who wants to build their own fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>So that replicating their device would be easy, they wanted to make it using inexpensive, readily available components, which is why they turned to Raspberry Pi technology.</p>

<p>Inside the RaspiReader’s 3D-printed housing, LEDs shine light through an acrylic prism, on top of which the user rests their finger. The prism refracts the light so that the two Camera Modules can take images from different angles. The Pi receives these images via a <a href=""http://www.arducam.com/multi-camera-adapter-module-raspberry-pi/"">Multi Camera Adapter Module</a> feeding into the CSI port. Collecting two images means the researchers’ spoof detection algorithm has more information to work with.</p>

<h2>RaspiReader software</h2>
<p>The Camera Adaptor uses the <code class=""Brush plain""><a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO"">RPi.GPIO</a></code> Python package. The RaspiReader performs image processing, and its spoof detection takes image colour and 3D friction ridge patterns into account. The detection algorithm extracts <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_binary_patterns"">colour local binary patterns</a> … please don’t ask me to explain! You can have a look at the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07887.pdf"">researchers’ manuscript</a> if you want to get stuck into the fine details of their project.</p>

38,403,15423726,Thoughts on Microsoft's Time-Travel Debugger,2017-10-07 16:43:05,http://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/10/thoughts-on-microsofts-time-travel.html?m=1,[],2,"<html><body><div><div class=""post-body entry-content"" id=""post-body-6631475227285672446"" itemprop=""articleBody"">
<p>I'm excited that Microsoft's <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/time-travel-debugging-overview"">TTD</a> is finally available to the public. Congratulations to the team! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1YJTg_A914"">The video</a> is well worth watching. I haven't used TTD myself yet since I don't have a Windows system at hand, but I've talked to Mozilla developers who've tried it on Firefox.
</p><p>The most important and obvious difference between TTD and rr is that TTD is for Windows and rr is for Linux (though a few crazy people have had success debugging Windows applications in Wine under rr).
</p><p>TTD supports recording of multiple threads in parallel, while rr is limited to a single core. On the other hand, per-thread recording overhead seems to be much higher in TTD than in rr. It's hard to make a direct comparison, but a simple ""start Firefox, display <a href=""https://mozilla.org"">mozilla.org</a>, shut down"" test run on similar hardware takes about 250 seconds under TTD and 26 seconds under rr. This is not surprising given TTD relies on <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/vee06/full_papers/p154-bhansali.pdf"">pervasive binary instrumentation</a> and rr was designed not to. This means recording extremely parallel workloads might be faster under TTD, but for many workloads rr recording will be faster. Starting up a large application really stresses binary translation frameworks, so it's a bit of a worst-case scenario for TTD — though a common one for developers. TTD's multicore recording might be better at reproducing certain kinds of concurrency bugs, though rr's <a href=""/2016/02/introducing-rr-chaos-mode.html"">chaos mode</a> helps mitigate that problem — and lower recording overhead means you can churn through test iterations faster.
</p><p>Therefore for Firefox-like workloads, on Linux, I still think rr's recording approach is superior. Note that when the technology behind TTD was first developed the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05937.pdf"">hardware and OS features</a> needed to support an rr-like approach did not exist.
</p><p>TTD's ability to attach to arbitrary processes and start recording sounds great and would mitigate some of the slow-recording problem. This would be nice to have with rr, but hard to implement. (Currently we require reserving a couple of pages at specific addresses that might not be available when attaching to an arbitrary process.)
</p><p>Some of the performance overhead of TTD comes from it copying all loaded libraries into the trace file, to ensure traces are portable across machines. rr doesn't do that by default; instead you have to run <tt>rr pack</tt> to make traces self-contained. I still like our approach, especially in scenarios where you repeatedly re-record a testcase until it fails.
</p><p>The video mentions that TTD supports shared memory and async I/O and suggests rr doesn't. It can be confusing, but to clarify: rr supports shared memory as long as you record all the processes that are using the shared memory; for example Firefox and Chromium communicate with subprocesses using shared memory and work fine under rr. Async I/O is pretty rare in Linux; where it has come up so far (V4L2) we have been able to handle it.
</p><p>Supporting unlimited data breakpoints is a nice touch. I assume that's done using their binary instrumentation.
</p><p>TTD's replay looks fast in the demo videos but they mention that it can be slower than live debugging. They have an offline index build step, though it's not clear to me yet what exactly those indexes contain. It would be interesting to compare TTD and rr replay speed, especially for reverse execution.
</p><p>The TTD trace querying tools look cool. A lot more can be done in this area.
</p><p>rr+gdb supports running application functions at debug time (e.g. to dump data structures), while TTD does not. This feature is very important to some rr users, so it might be worthwhile for the TTD people to look at.

Our aim is to demonstrate the capabilities of modern computer vision and graphics technology, and convey it in an approachable and fun way. We want to emphasize that computer-generated videos have been part in feature-film movies for over 30 years. Virtually every high-end movie production contains a significant percentage of synthetically-generated content (from Lord of the Rings to Benjamin Button). These results are hard to distinguish from reality and it often goes unnoticed that the content is not real. The novelty and contribution of our work is that we can edit pre-recorded videos in real-time on a commodity PC. Please also note that our efforts include the detection of edits in video footage in order to verify a clip’s authenticity. For additional information, we refer to our project website (see above). Hopefully, you enjoyed watching our video, and we hope to provide a positive takeaway :)<br/><br/>Paper Abstract<br/>We present a novel approach for real-time facial reenactment of a monocular target video sequence (e.g., Youtube video). The source sequence is also a monocular video stream, captured live with a commodity webcam. Our goal is to animate the facial expressions of the target video by a source actor and re-render the manipulated output video in a photo-realistic fashion. To this end, we first address the under-constrained problem of facial identity recovery from monocular video by non-rigid model-based bundling. At run time, we track facial expressions of both source and target video using a dense photometric consistency measure. Reenactment is then achieved by fast and efficient deformation transfer between source and target. The mouth interior that best matches the re-targeted expression is retrieved from the target sequence and warped to produce an accurate fit. Finally, we convincingly re-render the synthesized target face on top of the corresponding video stream such that it seamlessly blends with the real-world illumination. We demonstrate our method in a live setup, where Youtube videos are reenacted in real time.</p></div>  </div></body></html>",0

<p><span class=""drop-cap""><span class=""drop-cap__inner"">J</span></span>ustin Rosenstein had tweaked his laptop’s operating system to block Reddit, banned himself from Snapchat, which he compares to heroin, and imposed limits on his use of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Facebook</a>. But even that wasn’t enough. In August, the 34-year-old tech executive took a more radical step to restrict his use of social media and other addictive technologies.</p>
<p>Rosenstein purchased a new iPhone and instructed his assistant to set up a parental-control feature to prevent him from downloading any apps. </p>
<p>He was particularly aware of the allure of Facebook “likes”, which he describes as “bright dings of pseudo-pleasure” that can be as hollow as they are seductive. And Rosenstein should know: he was the Facebook engineer who created the “like” button in the first place. </p>
<p>A decade after he stayed up all night coding a prototype of what was then called an “awesome” button, Rosenstein belongs to a small but growing band of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Silicon Valley</a> heretics who complain about the rise of the so-called “attention economy”: an internet shaped around the demands of an advertising economy.</p>
<p>These refuseniks are rarely founders or chief executives, who have little incentive to deviate from the mantra that their companies are making the world a better place. Instead, they tend to have worked a rung or two down the corporate ladder: designers, engineers and product managers who, like Rosenstein, several years ago put in place the building blocks of a digital world from which they are now trying to disentangle themselves. “It is very common,” Rosenstein says, “for humans to develop things with the best of intentions and for them to have unintended, negative consequences.”</p>
<p>Rosenstein, who also helped create Gchat during a stint at Google, and now leads a <a href=""https://asana.com/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">San Francisco-based company</a> that improves office productivity, appears most concerned about the psychological effects on people who, <a href=""https://blog.dscout.com/mobile-touches"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">research shows</a>, touch, swipe or tap their phone 2,617 times a day.</p>
<p>There is growing concern that as well as addicting users, technology is contributing toward so-called “continuous partial attention”, severely limiting people’s ability to focus, and possibly lowering IQ. <a href=""http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">One recent study</a> showed that the mere presence of smartphones damages cognitive capacity – even when the device is turned off. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”</p>

<p>But those concerns are trivial compared with the devastating impact upon the political system that some of Rosenstein’s peers believe can be attributed to the rise of social media and the attention-based market that drives it.</p>
<p>Drawing a straight line between addiction to social media and political earthquakes like Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump, they contend that digital forces have completely upended the political system and, left unchecked, could even render democracy as we know it obsolete.</p>
<p>In 2007, Rosenstein was one of a small group of Facebook employees who decided to create a path of least resistance – a single click – to “send little bits of positivity” across the platform. Facebook’s “like” feature was, Rosenstein says, “wildly” successful: engagement soared as people enjoyed the short-term boost they got from giving or receiving social affirmation, while Facebook harvested valuable data about the preferences of users that could be sold to advertisers. The idea was soon copied by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Twitter</a>, with its heart-shaped “likes” (previously star-shaped “favourites”), Instagram, and countless other apps and websites.</p>
<p>It was Rosenstein’s colleague, Leah Pearlman, then a product manager at Facebook and on the team that created the Facebook “like”, who announced the feature in a 2009 blogpost. Now 35 and an illustrator, Pearlman confirmed via email that she, too, <a href=""https://www.theringer.com/2017/2/15/16038024/how-the-like-button-took-over-the-internet-ebe778be2459"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">has grown disaffected</a> with Facebook “likes” and other addictive feedback loops. She has installed a web browser plug-in to eradicate her Facebook news feed, and hired a social media manager to monitor her Facebook page so that she doesn’t have to.</p>

<p>“One reason I think it is particularly important for us to talk about this now is that we may be the last generation that can remember life before,” Rosenstein says. It may or may not be relevant that Rosenstein, Pearlman and most of the tech insiders questioning today’s attention economy are in their 30s, members of the last generation that can remember a world in which telephones were plugged into walls. </p>
<p>It is revealing that many of these younger technologists are weaning themselves off their own products, sending their children to elite Silicon Valley schools where iPhones, iPads and even laptops are banned. They appear to be <a href=""https://twitter.com/PaulLewis/status/843126905687621632"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">abiding by a Biggie Smalls lyric</a> from their own youth about the perils of dealing crack cocaine: never get high on your own supply.</p>

<p>One morning in April this year, designers, programmers and tech entrepreneurs from across the world gathered at a conference centre on the shore of the San Francisco Bay. They had each paid up to $1,700 to learn how to manipulate people into habitual use of their products, on a course curated by conference organiser Nir Eyal.</p>
<p>Eyal, 39, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has spent several years consulting for the tech industry, teaching techniques he developed by closely studying how the Silicon Valley giants operate. </p>

<p>“The technologies we use have turned into compulsions, if not full-fledged addictions,” Eyal writes. “It’s the impulse to check a message notification. It’s the pull to visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later.” None of this is an accident, he writes. It is all “just as their designers intended”. </p>
<p>He explains the subtle psychological tricks that can be used to make people develop habits, such as varying the rewards people receive to create “a craving”, or exploiting negative emotions that can act as “triggers”. “Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation,” Eyal writes.</p>
<p>Attendees of the 2017 Habit Summit might have been surprised when Eyal walked on stage to announce that this year’s keynote speech was about “something a little different”. He wanted to address the growing concern that technological manipulation was somehow harmful or immoral. He told his audience that they should be careful not to abuse persuasive design, and wary of crossing a line into coercion.</p>
<p>But he was defensive of the techniques he teaches, and dismissive of those who compare tech addiction to drugs. “We’re not freebasing Facebook and injecting Instagram here,” he said. He flashed up a slide of a shelf filled with sugary baked goods. “Just as we shouldn’t blame the baker for making such delicious treats, we can’t blame tech makers for making their products so good we want to use them,” he said. “Of course that’s what tech companies will do. And frankly: do we want it any other way?”</p>

<p>Without irony, Eyal finished his talk with some personal tips for resisting the lure of technology. He told his audience he uses a Chrome extension, called DF YouTube, “which scrubs out a lot of those external triggers” he writes about in his book, and recommended an app called Pocket Points that “rewards you for staying off your phone when you need to focus”. </p>
<p>Finally, Eyal confided the lengths he goes to protect his own family. He has installed in his house an outlet timer connected to a router that cuts off access to the internet at a set time every day. “The idea is to remember that we are not powerless,” he said. “We are in control.”</p>
<p>But are we? If the people who built these technologies are taking such radical steps to wean themselves free, can the rest of us reasonably be expected to exercise our free will?</p>
<p>Not according to Tristan Harris, a 33-year-old former <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Google</a> employee turned vocal critic of the tech industry. “All of us are jacked into this system,” he says. “All of our minds can be hijacked. Our choices are not as free as we think they are.”</p>
<p>Harris, who <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">has been branded</a> “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”, insists that billions of people have little choice over whether they use these now ubiquitous technologies, and are largely unaware of the invisible ways in which a small number of people in Silicon Valley are shaping their lives.</p>
<p>A graduate of Stanford University, Harris studied under BJ Fogg, a behavioural psychologist revered in tech circles for mastering the ways technological design can be used to persuade people. Many of his students, including Eyal, have gone on to prosperous careers in Silicon Valley. </p>

<p>Harris is the student who went rogue; a whistleblower of sorts, he is lifting the curtain on the vast powers accumulated by technology companies and the ways they are using that influence. “A handful of people, working at a handful of technology companies, through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today,” he said at <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_the_manipulative_tricks_tech_companies_use_to_capture_your_attention"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">a recent TED talk</a> in Vancouver.</p>
<p>“I don’t know a more urgent problem than this,” Harris says. “It’s changing our democracy, and it’s changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships that we want with each other.” Harris went public – giving talks, writing papers, meeting lawmakers and campaigning for reform after three years struggling to effect change inside Google’s Mountain View headquarters.</p>
<p> It all began in 2013, when he was working as a product manager at Google, and circulated a thought-provoking memo, A Call To Minimise Distraction &amp; Respect Users’ Attention, to 10 close colleagues. It struck a chord, spreading to some 5,000 Google employees, including senior executives who rewarded Harris with an impressive-sounding new job: he was to be Google’s in-house design ethicist and product philosopher. </p>
<p>Looking back, Harris sees that he was promoted into a marginal role. “I didn’t have a social support structure at all,” he says. Still, he adds: “I got to sit in a corner and think and read and understand.”</p>
<p> He explored how LinkedIn exploits a need for social reciprocity to widen its network; how YouTube and Netflix autoplay videos and next episodes, depriving users of a choice about whether or not they want to keep watching; how Snapchat created its addictive Snapstreaks feature, encouraging near-constant communication between its mostly teenage users.</p>

<p>The techniques these companies use are not always generic: they can be algorithmically tailored to each person. An internal Facebook report <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/01/facebook-advertising-data-insecure-teens"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">leaked this year</a>, for example, revealed that the company can identify when teens feel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Such granular information, Harris adds, is “a perfect model of what buttons you can push in a particular person”.</p>
<p>Tech companies can exploit such vulnerabilities to keep people hooked; manipulating, for example, when people receive “likes” for their posts, ensuring they arrive when an individual is likely to feel vulnerable, or in need of approval, or maybe just bored. And the very same techniques can be sold to the highest bidder. “There’s no ethics,” he says. A company paying Facebook to use its levers of persuasion could be a car business targeting tailored advertisements to different types of users who want a new vehicle. Or it could be a Moscow-based troll farm seeking to turn voters in a swing county in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Harris believes that tech companies never deliberately set out to make their products addictive. They were responding to the incentives of an advertising economy, experimenting with techniques that might capture people’s attention, even stumbling across highly effective design by accident.</p>
<p>A friend at Facebook told Harris that designers initially decided the notification icon, which alerts people to new activity such as “friend requests” or “likes”, should be blue. It fit Facebook’s style and, the thinking went, would appear “subtle and innocuous”. “But no one used it,” Harris says. “Then they switched it to red and of course everyone used it.”</p>

<p> That red icon is now everywhere. When smartphone users glance at their phones, dozens or hundreds of times a day, they are confronted with small red dots beside their apps, pleading to be tapped. “Red is a trigger colour,” Harris says. “That’s why it is used as an alarm signal.”</p>
<p>The most seductive design, Harris explains, exploits the same psychological susceptibility that makes gambling so compulsive: variable rewards. When we tap those apps with red icons, we don’t know whether we’ll discover an interesting email, an avalanche of “likes”, or nothing at all. It is the possibility of disappointment that makes it so compulsive.<br/></p>
<p>It’s this that explains how the pull-to-refresh mechanism, whereby users swipe down, pause and wait to see what content appears, rapidly became one of the most addictive and ubiquitous design features in modern technology. “Each time you’re swiping down, it’s like a slot machine,” Harris says. “You don’t know what’s coming next. Sometimes it’s a beautiful photo. Sometimes it’s just an ad.”<br/></p>
<h2><strong><span class=""bullet"">•</span><span class=""bullet"">•</span><span class=""bullet"">•</span></strong></h2>
<p> The designer who created the pull-to-refresh mechanism, first used to update Twitter feeds, is Loren Brichter, widely admired in the app-building community for his sleek and intuitive designs. </p>
<p>Now 32, Brichter says he never intended the design to be addictive – but would not dispute the slot machine comparison. “I agree 100%,” he says. “I have two kids now and I regret every minute that I’m not paying attention to them because my smartphone has sucked me in.”</p>
<p>Brichter created the feature in 2009 for Tweetie, his startup, mainly because he could not find anywhere to fit the “refresh” button on his app. Holding and dragging down the feed to update seemed at the time nothing more than a “cute and clever” fix. Twitter acquired Tweetie the following year, integrating pull-to-refresh into its own app. </p>
<p>Since then the design has become one of the most widely emulated features in apps; the downward-pull action is, for hundreds of millions of people, as intuitive as scratching an itch.</p>

</aside>
<p>Brichter says he is puzzled by the longevity of the feature. In an era of push notification technology, apps can automatically update content without being nudged by the user. “It could easily retire,” he says. Instead it appears to serve a psychological function: after all, slot machines would be far less addictive if gamblers didn’t get to pull the lever themselves. Brichter prefers another comparison: that it is like the redundant “close door” button in some elevators with automatically closing doors. “People just like to push it.”</p>
<p>All of which has left Brichter, who has put his design work on the backburner while he focuses on building a house in New Jersey, questioning his legacy. “I’ve spent many hours and weeks and months and years thinking about whether anything I’ve done has made a net positive impact on society or humanity at all,” he says. He has blocked certain websites, turned off push notifications, restricted his use of the Telegram app to message only with his wife and two close friends, and tried to wean himself off Twitter. “I still waste time on it,” he confesses, “just reading stupid news I already know about.” He charges his phone in the kitchen, plugging it in at 7pm and not touching it until the next morning.</p>
<p>“Smartphones are useful tools,” he says. “But they’re addictive. Pull-to-refresh is addictive. Twitter is addictive. These are not good things. When I was working on them, it was not something I was mature enough to think about. I’m not saying I’m mature now, but I’m a little bit more mature, and I regret the downsides.”</p>
<p>Not everyone in his field appears racked with guilt. The two inventors listed on Apple’s patent for “managing notification connections and displaying icon badges” are Justin Santamaria and Chris Marcellino. Both were in their early 20s when they were hired by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple"" data-link-name=""auto-linked-tag"" data-component=""auto-linked-tag"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Apple</a> to work on the iPhone. As engineers, they worked on the behind-the-scenes plumbing for push-notification technology, introduced in 2009 to enable real-time alerts and updates to hundreds of thousands of third-party app developers. It was a revolutionary change, providing the infrastructure for so many experiences that now form a part of people’s daily lives, from ordering an Uber to making a Skype call to receiving breaking news updates.<br/></p>

<p>But notification technology also enabled a hundred unsolicited interruptions into millions of lives, accelerating the arms race for people’s attention. Santamaria, 36, who now runs a startup after a stint as the head of mobile at Airbnb, says the technology he developed at Apple was not “inherently good or bad”. “This is a larger discussion for society,” he says. “Is it OK to shut off my phone when I leave work? Is it OK if I don’t get right back to you? Is it OK that I’m not ‘liking’ everything that goes through my Instagram screen?” </p>
<p>His then colleague, Marcellino, agrees. “Honestly, at no point was I sitting there thinking: let’s hook people,” he says. “It was all about the positives: these apps connect people, they have all these uses – ESPN telling you the game has ended, or WhatsApp giving you a message for free from your family member in Iran who doesn’t have a message plan.”</p>
<p>A few years ago Marcellino, 33, left the Bay Area, and is now in the final stages of retraining to be a neurosurgeon. He stresses he is no expert on addiction, but says he has picked up enough in his medical training to know that technologies can affect the same neurological pathways as gambling and drug use. “These are the same circuits that make people seek out food, comfort, heat, sex,” he says.</p>
<p>All of it, he says, is reward-based behaviour that activates the brain’s dopamine pathways. He sometimes finds himself clicking on the red icons beside his apps “to make them go away”, but is conflicted about the ethics of exploiting people’s psychological vulnerabilities. “It is not inherently evil to bring people back to your product,” he says. “It’s capitalism.”</p>
<p>That, perhaps, is the problem. Roger McNamee, a venture capitalist who benefited from hugely profitable investments in Google and Facebook, has grown disenchanted with both companies, arguing that their early missions have been distorted by the fortunes they have been able to earn through advertising. </p>

<p>He identifies the advent of the smartphone as a turning point, raising the stakes in an arms race for people’s attention. “Facebook and Google assert with merit that they are giving users what they want,” McNamee says. “The same can be said about tobacco companies and drug dealers.”</p>
<p>That would be a remarkable assertion for any early investor in Silicon Valley’s most profitable behemoths. But McNamee, 61, is more than an arms-length money man. Once an adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, 10 years ago McNamee introduced the Facebook CEO to his friend, Sheryl Sandberg, then a Google executive who had overseen the company’s advertising efforts. Sandberg, of course, became chief operating officer at Facebook, transforming the social network into another advertising heavyweight. </p>
<p>McNamee chooses his words carefully. “The people who run Facebook and Google are good people, whose well-intentioned strategies have led to horrific unintended consequences,” he says. “The problem is that there is nothing the companies can do to address the harm unless they abandon their current advertising models.”</p>

<p>But how can Google and Facebook be forced to abandon the business models that have transformed them into two of the most profitable companies on the planet?</p>
<p>McNamee believes the companies he invested in should be subjected to greater regulation, including new anti-monopoly rules. In Washington, there is growing appetite, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/tech-industry-washington-google-amazon-apple-facebook"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">on both sides of the political divide</a>, to rein in Silicon Valley. But McNamee worries the behemoths he helped build may already be too big to curtail. “The EU recently penalised Google $2.42bn for anti-monopoly violations, and Google’s shareholders just shrugged,” he says.</p>
<p>Rosenstein, the Facebook “like” co-creator, believes there may be a case for state regulation of “psychologically manipulative advertising”, saying the moral impetus is comparable to taking action against fossil fuel or tobacco companies. “If we only care about profit maximisation,” he says, “we will go rapidly into dystopia.”<br/></p>

<p>James Williams does not believe talk of dystopia is far-fetched. The ex-Google strategist who built the metrics system for the company’s global search advertising business, he has had a front-row view of an industry he describes as the “largest, most standardised and most centralised form of attentional control in human history”.</p>
<p>Williams, 35, left Google last year, and is on the cusp of completing a PhD at Oxford University exploring the ethics of persuasive design. It is a journey that has led him to question whether democracy can survive the new technological age.</p>
<p>He says his epiphany came a few years ago, when he noticed he was surrounded by technology that was inhibiting him from concentrating on the things he wanted to focus on. “It was that kind of individual, existential realisation: what’s going on?” he says. “Isn’t technology supposed to be doing the complete opposite of this?”<br/></p>
<p>That discomfort was compounded during a moment at work, when he glanced at one of Google’s dashboards, a multicoloured display showing how much of people’s attention the company had commandeered for advertisers. “I realised: this is literally a million people that we’ve sort of nudged or persuaded to do this thing that they weren’t going to otherwise do,” he recalls.</p>
<p>He embarked on several years of independent research, much of it conducted while working part-time at Google. About 18 months in, he saw the Google memo circulated by Harris and the pair became allies, struggling to bring about change from within.</p>

<p> Williams and Harris left Google around the same time, and co-founded an advocacy group, <a href=""http://www.timewellspent.io/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">Time Well Spent</a>, that seeks to build public momentum for a change in the way big tech companies think about design. Williams finds it hard to comprehend why this issue is not “on the front page of every newspaper every day. </p>
<p>“Eighty-seven percent of people wake up and go to sleep with their smartphones,” he says. The entire world now has a new prism through which to understand politics, and Williams worries the consequences are profound.</p>
<p>The same forces that led tech firms to hook users with design tricks, he says, also encourage those companies to depict the world in a way that makes for compulsive, irresistible viewing. “The attention economy incentivises the design of technologies that grab our attention,” he says. “In so doing, it privileges our impulses over our intentions.” </p>
<p>That means privileging what is sensational over what is nuanced, appealing to emotion, anger and outrage. The news media is increasingly working in service to tech companies, Williams adds, and must play by the rules of the attention economy to “sensationalise, bait and entertain in order to survive”.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the wake of Donald Trump’s stunning electoral victory, many were quick to question the role of so-called “fake news” on Facebook, Russian-created Twitter bots or the data-centric targeting efforts that companies such as Cambridge Analytica used to sway voters. But Williams sees those factors as symptoms of a deeper problem. </p>
<p>It is not just shady or bad actors who were exploiting the internet to change public opinion. The attention economy itself is set up to promote a phenomenon like Trump, who is masterly at grabbing and retaining the attention of supporters and critics alike, often by exploiting or creating outrage.</p>
<p>Williams was making this case before the president was elected. <a href=""http://quillette.com/2016/10/03/the-clickbait-candidate/"" data-link-name=""in body link"" class=""u-underline in-body-link--immersive"">In a blog published a month before the US election</a>, Williams sounded the alarm bell on an issue he argued was a “far more consequential question” than whether Trump reached the White House. The reality TV star’s campaign, he said, had heralded a watershed in which “the new, digitally supercharged dynamics of the attention economy have finally crossed a threshold and become manifest in the political realm”.</p>

</aside>
<p>Williams saw a similar dynamic unfold months earlier, during the Brexit campaign, when the attention economy appeared to him biased in favour of the emotional, identity-based case for the UK leaving the European Union. He stresses these dynamics are by no means isolated to the political right: they also play a role, he believes, in the unexpected popularity of leftwing politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn, and the frequent outbreaks of internet outrage over issues that ignite fury among progressives. </p>
<p>All of which, Williams says, is not only distorting the way we view politics but, over time, may be changing the way we think, making us less rational and more impulsive. “We’ve habituated ourselves into a perpetual cognitive style of outrage, by internalising the dynamics of the medium,” he says.<br/></p>
<p>It is against this political backdrop that Williams argues the fixation in recent years with the surveillance state fictionalised by George Orwell may have been misplaced. It was another English science fiction writer, Aldous Huxley, who provided the more prescient observation when he warned that Orwellian-style coercion was less of a threat to democracy than the more subtle power of psychological manipulation, and “man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions”.</p>
<p>Since the US election, Williams has explored another dimension to today’s brave new world. If the attention economy erodes our ability to remember, to reason, to make decisions for ourselves – faculties that are essential to self-governance – what hope is there for democracy itself?</p>
<p> “The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will,” he says. “If politics is an expression of our human will, on individual and collective levels, then the attention economy is directly undermining the assumptions that democracy rests on.” If Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat are gradually chipping away at our ability to control our own minds, could there come a point, I ask, at which democracy no longer functions?</p>
<p> “Will we be able to recognise it, if and when it happens?” Williams replies. “And if we can’t, then how do we know it hasn’t happened already?”</p>

																										<p>Hany Farid, a computer scientist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, specialises in detecting manipulated images and videos. Farid, who provides his services to clients as varied as universities, media organizations, and law courts, says that image manipulation is becoming both more frequent and more sophisticated. He spoke to <i>Nature</i> about the arms race to stay ahead of the forgers.</p>																				<h2>Where do you start when trying to spot a fake image?</h2>																				<p>One simple but powerful technique is reverse image search. You give the image to a site such as Google Image Search or TinEye, and they show you all other instances of it. A <a href=""http://www.ee.columbia.edu/ln/dvmm/memex/index.html#About"">project at Columbia University</a>, in New York City, is taking this to the next level, and starting to find parts of images that have been repurposed from other images<b>. </b></p>																				<p><b>

	</div>
</b>Generally, we think about which patterns, geometries, colours or structures are going to be disrupted when someone manipulates a photo. For example, when people add an object into a scene, we know that where they put the shadow is usually wrong. A viral video called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0Q904gtMI"">Golden Eagle Snatches Kid</a> from 2012 is one of my favourite examples. It took us only 15 minutes of analysis to show shadow inconsistencies: the eagle and baby were computer-generated.</p>																				<h2>What about if fake images make only slight tweaks?</h2>																				<p>There are a number of analyses we can do. In a colour picture, every pixel needs three values — corresponding to the amounts of red, green and blue at that point. But in most cameras, every pixel records just one colour, and the camera fills in the gaps by taking the average values of the pixels around it. This means that, for any given colour in an image, each missing pixel has a particular correlation with its neighbours, which will be destroyed if we add or airbrush something, and we can detect that<b>.<br/>
<br/>
</b>Another technique is JPEG compression. Almost every image is stored in a JPEG file, which throws away some information to save on storage. There is a huge amount of variation in how each camera does that. If a JPEG is unpacked — opened in Photoshop — and then put back together, it is always repackaged slightly differently, and we can detect that. I wish you could just upload any image and we could tell you if it’s real or not, but it’s still a very difficult process and requires expertise to understand different components.</p>																				<h2>Who uses your digital forensic services?</h2>																				<p>I do analysis for organisations such as the Associated Press, Reuters, and <i>The New York Times</i>. There are only a handful of academics worldwide who are specialists in this, so it doesn’t scale — and that means you can only do the analysis of really high-stakes images. But there are efforts under way to scale this up. Last year, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) got into this game with a <a href=""https://www.darpa.mil/program/media-forensics"">large project</a> of which I’m part. Over the next five years they’re trying to create a system that will allow you to analyse hundreds of thousands of images a day. It’s a very ambitious programme.</p>																				<p>I also do a lot of work in the courts. For example, here in the United States, child pornography is illegal, but computer-generated child pornography counts as 'protected speech' under the First Amendment. If someone’s arrested they might say that the offending image isn’t real, and I might have to prove that it is. I also get lots of e-mails from people about photo hoaxes — almost daily.</p>																				<h2>Do you apply your techniques to scientific papers?</h2>																				<p>I have worked on many cases of scientific misconduct, hired by universities conducting internal investigations. When I visited the US Office of Research Integrity recently, they asked me “how do we get our hands on automated tools?” The reality is we’re still not there. But creating something that uses some of the tools, such as clone detection, which looks to see whether parts of an image have been copied and pasted from elsewhere, would be possible as a semi-automated process looking at dozens, not millions, of images a day. It’s something my colleagues and I are thinking about, and it’s a small but not insignificant part of the DARPA programme.</p>																				<h2>How about fake videos? </h2>																				<p>Researchers are now able to splice together footage to create videos of famous people seeming to say things they never said — for instance, <a href=""https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffutureoffakenews.com%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7CHany.Farid%40dartmouth.edu%7C99cdc415649647d8c9f008d4f4655b5e%7C995b093648d640e5a31ebf689ec9446f%7C0%7C0%7C636402163572640647&amp;sdata=9HhC%2FNxrb9JIPwpwxHIoGjZd8bZVHsP7fP9xqlZPAog%3D&amp;reserved=0"">this video of President Obama</a>. And they can create fake images or short videos using machine learning techniques: in particular, <a href=""https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnews%2Fastronomers-explore-uses-for-ai-generated-images-1.21398&amp;data=02%7C01%7CHany.Farid%40dartmouth.edu%7C99cdc415649647d8c9f008d4f4655b5e%7C995b093648d640e5a31ebf689ec9446f%7C0%7C0%7C636402163572640647&amp;sdata=DCWL29NaKM73X%2BabDBN%2FLg%2BDOUbwt%2BOKqOmRvIBlf%2FA%3D&amp;reserved=0"">generative adversarial networks</a> (GANs), which learn to generate fake content. These pit a network that generates fake content against a ‘classifer’ network that attempts to discriminate between real and fake content, so that the faking network rapidly improves.</p>																				<p>I’ve seen the technology get good enough that I’m now very concerned. In 5 or 10 years, this is going to get really good. At some point we will reach a stage where we can generate realistic video, with audio, of a world leader, and that’s going to be very disconcerting. I would say that the field of digital forensics is now behind in video.</p>																				<h2>How can you detect fake video?</h2>																				<p>JPEG compression has an analogous construct in video, which is a bit harder to detect because video uses a more sophisticated version. Another approach is to use machine learning for detection. But we’re taking an approach similar to what we do with images — which is based on the observation that computer-generated content lacks the imperfections that are present in a recorded video. It’s created in almost too perfect a world. So one of the things we look at is, are we not seeing the statistical and geometric patterns we’d expect to see in the physical world?<br/>
<br/>
Another technique is based on some <a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/#people"">beautiful work by William Freeman and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge</a>, who showed how if you magnify really small changes in a video of a person, you can see subtle changes in the colours in their face that correspond to their pulse rate. We showed that you can use this to distinguish real people from computer-generated people. </p>																				<h2>Couldn’t machine learning algorithms learn to include these features?</h2>																				<p>Perhaps in principle. But in practice, these algorithms have limited time and training data, and there is little control over which features a neural network will pick up on to discriminate between real and fake videos. A GAN is only trying to fool the classifier it’s trained on. That’s no guarantee that it will learn all aspects of what makes an image or video real or fake, or that it will fool another classifier.</p>																				<p>My adversary will have to implement all the forensic techniques that I use, so that the neural network can learn to circumvent these analyses: for example, by adding a pulse in. In that way, I’ve made their job a little harder.</p>																				<p>It’s an arms race. As we are developing faster, folks are creating more sophisticated technology to augment audio, images and video. The way this is going to end is that you take the ability to create a perfect fake out of the hands of the amateur. You make it harder, so it takes more time and skill, and there’s a greater risk of getting caught.</p>

						<p>Last week, the Project Loon team revealed that it was exploring the possibility of deploying balloons to provide “emergency connectivity” to Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

<p>Freelance journalist <a href=""http://www.meharris.com/"">Mark Harris</a> spotted that Project Loon was <a href=""https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/els/reports/STA_Print.cfm?mode=initial&amp;application_seq=80734"">granted permission earlier today</a> by the FCC to provide the coverage to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the Project Loon team at Alphabet’s X division noted to <em><a href=""http://mashable.com/2017/09/28/project-loon-deployment-puerto-rico/#oM_vraiGn5qx"">Mashable</a></em> that they were “working hard with the Puerto Rican authorities to see if there’s a way for us to use Loon balloons to bring some emergency connectivity to the island during this time of need.”</p>
<p>At the time, they noted that deploying to Puerto Rico would be harder than their previous emergency <a href=""https://blog.x.company/helping-out-in-peru-9e5a84839fd2"">deployment to Peru</a> as they did not have existing infrastructure in place. In the latter country, Project Loon was already testing with a local carrier before the nation encountered heavy flooding.</p>
<p>Project Loon works by having telecommunication partners beam up service to a balloon, which in turn gets relayed across a network of balloons and then directly to LTE devices on the ground.</p>
<p>However, it appears that the lack of an existing infrastructure did not pose too significant of a delay. Harris <a href=""https://twitter.com/meharris/status/916436843771478016"">notes in a series of tweets</a> that over the past week, the Loon team <a href=""https://twitter.com/meharris/status/916437397373468673"">secured</a> “spectrum rights from wireless networks in PR and US Virgin Islands.”</p>

<p>As Harris spotted, earlier today the <a href=""https://twitter.com/meharris/status/916437763804692481"">FCC granted</a> a “<a href=""https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/els/reports/STA_Print.cfm?mode=initial&amp;application_seq=80734"">Special Temporary Authorization</a>” to “support licensed mobile carriers’ restoration of limited communications capability in areas of Puerto Rico.” Eight carriers in the region have temporarily handed over frequencies for six months, with X planning to use 30 Loon balloons when the service goes live.</p>

<p/></div>
<p>While the backend logistic issue have been resolved, phones on the ground will require a temporary update. In a filing, Loon notes that an OTA might be needed to allow Band 8 operation, with devices from Samsung, Apple, LG, and others cited as capable of being updated to support the upcoming LTE service.</p>

<p/></div>
<p>We’ve reached out to X to clarify whether they have already secured any commitments from OEMs to update their devices.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: X spokesperson Libby Leahy noted the following on the progress Loon has achieved so far:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re grateful for the support of the FCC and the Puerto Rican authorities as we work hard to see if it’s possible to use Loon balloons to bring emergency connectivity to the island during this time of need. To deliver signal to people’s devices, Loon needs be integrated with a telco partner’s network — the balloons can’t do it alone. We’ve been making solid progress on this next step and would like to thank everyone who’s been lending a hand.”</p></blockquote>
