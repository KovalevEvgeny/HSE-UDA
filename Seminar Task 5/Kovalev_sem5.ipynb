The old man said. What did you catch? One the first day. One the second and two the third. Very good. If i cannot fish with you. I wish i could show him what a man can ask. Fish. He had sailed for two hours resting in the stern and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard. I don’t think i can eat an entire one. He said. Now i’ll let him eat it well. Eat it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern. He is beautiful and noble and knows no fear of anything. I killed him well. Besides he thought everything kills everything else in some way. Fishing kills me exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy said. Drink this. He said to himself. During the day he had taken as he died. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in a swinging motion and tried to gentle the fingers. But it was too early for that. He said. I must cushion the pull of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough. Take a good rest small bird. He had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water that was a mile deep. Go see your friend or maybe it’s your mother. The shark came in a pack and he could see their wide flattened shovel-pointed heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins. They were fresh and hard and he barely got the knife in. The shivering increased as he pulled in and he could see the glow of havana was not so strong so that he was pulling on the line and his left hand resting on the gunwale. Then he just watched the road. I must save all my strength now. Christ i did not know he was so big. I’ll kill him though. He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been around ten o’clock at night.

      "The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark’s broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish. The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. The old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness. Come on galano. The old man said. Come in again. The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish. The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other. I could not expect to kill them he thought. I could have in my time. But i have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If i could have used a bat with two hands i could have killed the first one surely. Even now he thought. He did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a minor and his stripes still showed. I shouldn’t have gone out so far fish. He said. Neither for you nor for me. I’m sorry fish. Now he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come. I wish i had a stone for the knife. The old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. I should have brought a stone. You should have brought many things he thought.

      "The fisherman who was measuring him called. I believe it. The boy said. He went into the terrace and asked for a can of coffee. Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it. Anything more? No. Afterwards i will see what he can eat. What a fish it was. The proprietor said. There has never been such a fish. Those were two fine fish you took yesterday too. Damn my fish. The boy said and he started to cry again. Do you want a drink of any kind? The proprietor asked. No. The boy said. Tell them not to bother santiago. I’ll be back. Tell him how sorry i am. Thanks. The boy said. The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man’s shack and sat by him until he woke. Once it looked as though he were waking. But he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee. Finally the old man woke. Don’t sit up. The boy said. Drink this. He poured some of the coffee in a glass. The old man took it and drank it. They beat me manolin. He said. They truly beat me. He didn’t beat you. Not the fish. No. Truly. It was afterwards. Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the head? Let pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps. And the spear? You keep it if you want it. I want it. The boy said. Now we must make our plans about the other things. Did they search for me? Of course. With coast guard and with planes. The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see. The old man said. He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea. I missed you. He said. What did you catch? One the first day. One the second and two the third. Very good. Now we fish together again. No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore. The hell with luck. The boy said. I’ll bring the luck with me. What will your family say? I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for i still have much to learn. We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board.
